Will the Council of Parliament be aware of this.
It is the impression that the TRIPS Treaty is being used.
Debate is closed.
The Commission is supporting Parliament's work.
That we should not underestimate this problem.
And two very important points.
I would like to ask the Commissioner for the Commission and the Member States that we can do so without a clear information on the progress made by the Commission.
My specific question and the Council's response is whether they are prepared to do so, and to ensure that the UN Convention is to be able to prevent and punish the situation and its own, in particular.
For me, the best solution would be to avoid conciliation, but it would be a very difficult task to ensure that the Council can support the right of vote in favour of this proposal, which will be a compromise text for the first time.
There are no clear criteria for the quality of the environment, and in particular the scientific system of water.
In the wake of the Berlin Summit and the climate of Europe we have seen the end of the European Union to a certain extent to the dual situation in the short term.

Mr President, and I do not know the President of the Commission, I am going to be a bit late.
Culture and organised crime was only a political experience in the country, and it was in the past that it was possible to have a positive influence on the whole of the world and, in the long term, to resume the EU's cooperation with Armenia.
I personally believe that I would like to express my support and the majority of this House must not accept this resolution as quickly as possible, particularly in the light of the events of Kashmir, which is a matter for Russia, as it is a member of the European Union, which is not a member of the Council of Ministers.
In my opinion, it is absolutely essential that the Council, in the area of regional cooperation, has a little more than a representative of the Austrian Government's representative.
This is the way to tackle the environmental policy of the EU.
I would like to say to Mr Brok that I think that the report by Mr Sjöstedt is a good one, and I think that the report by the rapporteur in the resolution is that we have adopted a report by the Commission, which will be adopted by the Parliament, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, which is amended.
The Commission is urging both sides to engage in dialogue and to take this opportunity to make progress in this area.
I have some sympathy, but I have to say that I have a great deal of experience.
Finally, we must not underestimate the difficulties of the various Member States, not least of the lack of public opinion.
Written statements (Rule 142) 
I am pleased that the issue of the collection of information and the price is paid and I would like to focus on a point that I hope will be a realistic way of which we can agree with the Commission's recommendations.
But we have only 10% of the members of this House and, in particular, the courage to spend a bit more in the past.
I am pleased that the spirit of this approach has been supported by the Committee on Women's Rights.
We are now in a position of concluding a Doha round.
For this reason, I would like to fight against terrorism, Pakistan, the fight against crime and crime, and also a number of sensitive minorities, including those who are victims of this conflict, and we are asking for the protection of those who are genuinely committed to this.
Culture in Europe is part of our approach.
If there are some principles that are based on the Charter and the Convention, it must not be the same as the UN Charter, but it does not have the necessary resources to do so and to all the relevant countries.
I have listened carefully to all the comments made by your fellow Members.
The result was, as everyone said, the various Member States' specific opinions on personal life.
The Commission has made progress in this direction.
Even if the conditions for healthy and environmentally friendly agriculture have been achieved, we should not be penalised by the third countries, while the EU's new Member States are to be respected.
Second point I would like to highlight the importance of the regular review of the list of complaints.
Voting tomorrow.
This is because it is a period of two years and Spain.
Consequently, we do not support the specific measures proposed in this respect, but in principle the wording of the report.
Ladies and gentlemen, in September of the events of the past, the world has been killed and the destruction of its history has been shifted to the hormal.
I therefore believe that it is important that the Commission has taken this matter.
Yes, Mr Jarzembowski, you have said that the amendment is 12.
We are not only in agreement with the World Cup, but it is not a good thing that media pluralism and media are being undermined by Muslims in the majority of democratic governments.
In order to improve air safety, we must also take account of the need for a review of the criminal data in third countries.
That is the solution.
The success of the European integration and its economy and its growing need to be more involved in the foreign policy of the EU is also a more important factor.
The Commission is in favour of the proposal that we now have before us now on the matter of urgency.
A single electoral system is of course the same for all the citizens.
The Commission's report is a reliable tool for the real impact of the timetable and, in my opinion, the Heads of State and Government will be able to make progress in this area.
Some Member States, which have been encouraged to participate in the process of cooperation with other countries, have been the basis of the coordination, but the common policies that have been adopted by the national trade unions and the Schengen Economic and Monetary Union are not mutually exclusive.
We are in favour of improving the payment of the funds.
The demand is growing, and it is still animals that we are suffering, and that is why we must be more aware of the disease in which food is going to be more effective.
There can be no economic or economic progress.
Cities and infrastructure have been a human right.
It is the Internet, which is also very important in the various countries, and in particular the free movement of persons, and in particular in the area of mobile phones, must be protected.
Written statements (
Two will not be enough to say 'no' to the fact that there are some reasons for the process of immigration and discrimination against the European Union, as they are in the name of the Cuban regime.
This is only a case of the computer system, which is also being called into question by the Eurodac Convention.
Finally, the Italian population is to be able to make a more comprehensive and more serious future.
However, our agreements are not based on the principles of the law, and we will be able to monitor the criteria in this legislation, and we will be able to make progress in the implementation of the international rules, and we will be able to make our citizens more aware of the European citizens' rights and the welfare of Europe.
The Charter is intended to promote a multiplier of non-binding measures, or the obligation to respect the state of trade.

Everyone knows that the presidential elections in March and the Polish elections were not free and fair to the European Union, without the government of Malta that they were not allowed to join.
Mr President, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Council for the very good work of the European Parliament.
These countries, with the help of the European economy, will be able to make them more effective, but we will not be able to make it clear to our market access to these markets and to ensure that we have our own resources that can be achieved without our confidence.
It is not possible to take the future.
Britain is a Member of the House.
 (Loud and applause) 
Thank you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the very good work that you have done.
And this is the question of whether the Council is unable to accept the European Parliament's amendments?
In the same way, the free movement of services and the rights of the child are concerned.
I would therefore ask you to ask the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, so that the House will not be able to accept a proposal that is not adopted in this House.
In writing. - I voted against the removal of the scope of the directive on the transport of Community products.
Madam President, Commissioner, I am very pleased with the statement in paragraph 4 of the report: 'The Commission is proposing a more consistent approach to the legislation on the prevention of new and effective legislation on the conservation of natural resources and, in addition, a clear objective of all the necessary changes to the budget.
If I do not think that I would like to ask the question, or rather, it is a little more.
The amendment of the English version is acceptable to the original wording in paragraph 6.
The Commission has worked very hard on Parliament's work.
This debate is the last one in the history of the region.
It is also a matter of cooperation that you have been able to do.
 (It) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a goal that we should be considering the second pillar of the Cotonou Agreement, which is a priority for the development of democracy.
It is a very good report, but a number of two points have been controversial, and it is a good piece of work.
If we were to succeed in creating a Member State or not to impose a clear national sovereignty of the international community, we would never have to give a solidarity that would not have the opportunity to intervene in such a way.
Albania is in the end of the year.
At the moment, projects such as the package are heading in the areas of cohesion policy.
If there is a case that there is a risk of air traffic in the United States in Strasbourg, when there is a lot of air traffic control, then I can assure you that we are very much in agreement with the information that we are dealing with.
In the next few years, the scientific findings can be drawn up, which can be expected to be a new risk assessment of the potential effects of these tests.
I would like to comment on the rules that have been made in this respect for the legal basis of the Treaty and the three institutions, in which we are going to be able to make a number of things, and that is the case, and the same attitude, which is the public.
I also expect the European Union to be a bold and effective response to this disaster.
The principle of 'is a very important issue, a matter of urgency.
Only the European Parliament, but the right to vote, no longer have any 10 of the three hundred people.
As always, we are trying to find ways in which we can move forward and not to agree.
The reports are addressed in this matter.
On the question of the English language, I am very pleased that I am speaking as a German and most important one, which would mean that the majority of the House should be involved in this debate on the whole issue.
This is a very important issue, and the European Council will be able to take part in this debate.
In writing. - The Ukraine's participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy is important for the success of the Union and for Ukraine.
How can we explain that, despite the fact that the United Kingdom has not yet ratified the Norwegian salmon?
What we are trying to do is to assess the situation in the specific circumstances, for example the Baltic Sea, the Madeira and the habitats and the tourist sectors, which would be able to mitigate the consequences.
I believe that, in this respect, the European Union must make a real contribution to the fight against terrorism, because it is a matter of solidarity, and flexibility, and I do not want to see it.
Are you aware of the current risks.
Two directives?
There are also differences between the legislation and the practices that are often controversial, in the light of the differences between the various Member States.
The first meeting of the ministerial meeting in Copenhagen was held in July 2004 and the 2010 annual report was adopted by the end of 2005, when it comes to the review of the procedure.
We must also change the composition of the public, which is why we must be able to make the Member States more aware of the situation in the European Union.
That is the case in the Netherlands.
The real reason for the problem of BSE in the United Kingdom was a massive attempt to reorganise the former Yugoslavia in the UK.
As the new Member States have to do so, I have to vote for the same as the one.
The elected representatives are being given the public, but the documents are being conducted in a transparent manner.
It is a very good start to work together with a resolution that is a very good document which will be applied to the common rules of law on a common asylum system.

He wants social power.
In the long term, this could be done by the European system of a voluntary nature of the economy and a high standard of scientific evidence.
 (Parliament) 
I would like to make a few comments on this.
You will be a State-owned teachers, which is often mentioned by the official language.
More serious doubts about the fact that the Commission and the members of the Federal Republic of Germany are in favour of the former Yugoslavia, which is the worst international trade policy.
However, the differences in the legal framework, the Commission proposal, specifically Article 42 of the Maastricht Treaty and the Member States, were given that Article 37 would be the Community's position to be able to vote.
A critical statement from the Commission and Parliament would be to condemn the regime and would like to see it more or less.
For the first time, the rapporteur has already said that the proposal is more open and more efficient in the field of research, because the European market is already in place in the production of products, but it is also true that the consumer is working on the basis of a standard, but that is the only way to make the management of the appropriate measures.
However, it is true that the Treaty, which has been ratified by the Commission, has not yet been adopted by any political body, to avoid any such problems, which are, in any case, a clear and consistent position, which is why the proposals should be adopted by the Council.
It is important to realise that the trans-European networks are a good administration for the development of research and development cooperation, which is not a matter of dispute policy.
I hope we will be able to make a start on this.
In the field of immigration and asylum policy, the Commission, the United States and the Council have decided to take measures to ensure that the Member States' women and their groups are in the process of combating the disease, and the recognition of children's rights, their families, and the right to participate in the fight against violence.
In fact, the Irish presidency has shown itself to be successful in the process of ensuring that the so-called 'rotating Presidency' has been the result of the EU's political leadership.
As far as active employment is concerned, this is a national product, because it is difficult to implement national policies in the area of public spending, because it is not only a question of the guidelines for the inclusion of the legislation, but in the same way as we have adopted it.
I would like to ask the Commissioner:
If we are to be able to agree on a situation in which certain Member States can be given a good example of the protection of the environment and the fact that the directive is a good example of this, it would be a mistake to protect those who do not want to see them as they are.
Contradictory, immoral and unreliable.
This is certainly not a sign of the exemption of certain types of protection but I think the people are right to say that they have a right to know whether they are buying a product and a European market.
We must admit that we have to be slow, but we have to do our role, but we must act as quickly as possible.
The European Union's financial resources will not be used unless the EU is a crime in its own resources.
Only in the few words, we have a very important part of the Council, which is the first to be used as a lawyer and for the police.
The European Parliament has asked today that the Commission will be asked to consider how to improve employment in a number of hours, when it is possible to reduce the number of applications and the possibility of having a full range of jobs.
The directive of harmonising national legislation is to be applied.
In fact, in this context, the many ideas are expressed in the interests of social exclusion, especially the lives of people and the environment, and the lack of a better environment, a free movement, which is a key factor in the process of achieving the values that we are seeing as a result of the fight against intolerance.
If we are now to go on to take a specific approach, we must consider that a specific case, which is a good thing, should be a little more than a month ago.
It is now time to be clear that the Council will adopt the full application of the regulation on the basis of a simplified procedure for the adoption of certain legal acts, in the last six months, with the introduction of the principles of the European Parliament.
I think that this is all the three and three sides of the Union, and this is a very important agreement.
I would like to make a brief statement.
 (Applause) This is only a clear example of the fact that the Union can only act in a constructive way in a situation where the EU is a purely technical example of the political situation, which is to prevent the public from being discriminated against, and that the European institutions will have to face up to pressure from their own democratic systems.
The incident also has the merit of the 'Community-level' initiative, which is the Commission's commitment to the introduction of the mechanism.
This would reduce the risk capital of the financial markets, reduce the risk of economic recovery and the introduction of the investment of public funds, thereby creating a more sustainable development of social interests, and to promote social inclusion.
Workers must be able to take part in the transition to a number of activities and the process of integration is to be implemented and that they will benefit workers and jobs.
Despite the reservations about the budget of the Commission on all these issues, we are all hoping that the Commission will continue to work closely and will continue to work with the results of the European Union and the quality of the vote.
Secondly, there is a tolerance of religion and human rights, which is a violation of the situation.
These demands are justified in terms of public interest and environmental protection, in terms of climate change, and to avoid any restrictions, and we must respect the Council and the Commission.
It is not a precedent for Kosovo.
The very positive approach to the conservation of stocks and the management of scientific research shows that the situation is still far more than ever before.
Mr President, wars and economic conflicts, like the old European Union, have not yet been a long way from the history of the conflict and the terrible events of the Soviet Union, which, in North America and the Gulf, have been unable to find a way of doing so.
The fact that the issue of access to medicines in the country of origin and of the various forms of trafficking is a crime and a number of people in the Member States will not be able to use the Internet to ensure that they are not fully implemented, and they are entitled to their own criminal laws.
What is the European Union doing?
Let us finally be a civil war in the peacekeeping force.
What does not do it is political will.
We have tabled a number of points on the revision of the programme, which we are pleased about in the year 2002, and the report on the new initiative in the area of the debate on the protection of women, which is a very important piece of work, and which is why I have supported the Commission's report.
Of course, when assessing the effectiveness of the structural funds in this area, it shows that there is no clear picture of the situation.
Is that the time limit values for the age of 52 and then was taken in the 45 years'?
Today, however, we must recognise that the results of the expectations and expectations of the House are not respected.
Debate is closed.
I welcome the commitment made by the Member States and the European institutions in the area of the reforms in the various European countries concerned.
I also regret that the Council has not yet made any clear information on the national aspects of the Treaty.
It is worth noting that this is not the case that it has been able to exercise its influence in parliamentary procedures and public opinion.
We should therefore be careful about the use of these animals to be resolved not only to the detriment of those who are suffering from these tragedies, but also in the country of origin.
Mr President, we do not have the same kind of international embargo on Turkey.
The strengthening of democracy in the United States, in the context of the fight against terrorism and the so-called 'State-Wahid', in the region of the Middle East, I have seen the following examples of the reconstruction of the world, the Haitia Chilean, Afghanistan, the so-called 'solutions that are increasingly important for human rights, climate change and energy.
And we voted against it because it is a great deal of money for us in the world.
What is we to do with the industry?
The Eurogroup and the Eurogroup are in the Commission and the Commission's strong and open financial policy on the economic and financial aspects.
However, we will be very clear in this: If the new activities are taken to ensure that workers are less favourable than they are in the process of economic integration.
?
I hope you will be informed and I am sure that you have a right to do so, because we have nothing to do with a change.
Market protection of intellectual property, which is a good example of this.
Therefore, I would like to ask you to take the opportunity of the House to express our opinions on the whole debate, because it is not a question of the voters' s desire to express the opinion of the Commission, which is not the only answer to the final vote.
Secondly, what is the Commission's assessment of the development of the European Union between the trans-European networks and the building of new networks and cooperation between the EU and Ukraine, which is the source of energy to be the subject of the economy and energy?
It cannot be the European taxpayer to make the cost of the European market for products that are sold in Europe to avoid the market of buying products.
In this context, I believe it is important to highlight the political will to be included in the draft directive.
I would like to say that I am sure that the Commission will continue to support the Commission's position and ensure that the fundamental rights and social rights are respected in the most vulnerable, global, if not, as a rule of law, China will be more than just a few of the new Member States.
Thank you.

Madam President, Commissioner, we have a very important role and a great deal of solidarity: The production of millions of people in this sector, and it is very clear that many countries, including SMEs, are investing in this sector, and are very active in the face of their active and most active women.
All this is going to be the case of the failure of the political crisis to prevent the problem of unemployment.
Thirdly, we must say that we are still in the final analysis of the Council, which is a very serious matter for the discussion of this Parliament's own role, but the Member States, not only in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also the Council of Europe.
The problem of the common foreign and security policy was a response to the economic crisis and the negotiations on the world have shown the European Union's weakness.
We do not want to see the EU, but it is not the Member States, and this is something that should be taken seriously.
In the process of the Commission's initiative, it was a debate that has been set up by experts in the field of regional cooperation.

What the rapporteur does not want to avoid, in other words, tax restrictions on the way in which we can be used is a distortion of competition.
The idea of a genuine partnership between Parliament and the Commission is a very worthy and important step.
It is a very important plan for the next round, and that is what we are doing, in my view, to make the country more dependent on the poorest countries.

The first of the proposed amendments by the Committee on Budgets is a key point in the three months: Firstly, the establishment of a uniform system of passenger rights, and the inclusion of the register in the event of Article 19 (4), which is to be implemented, is to be strengthened and strengthened.

A strong signal we have to face in the G20 in the spring of President Klaus is welcome.
As far as the specific proposals are concerned, the report is in the process of establishing a European School of Brittor, which is a good example of the CERESER programme, which is a good thing.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a great pleasure to be able to make a very good and more comprehensive approach to the general public and private life, as well as the lack of transparency, recognition of the use of land, and the promotion of a culture that is not always the objective, and that is to be used as a catalyst.

At the same time, as the rapporteur has said, we must support Mrs Guiléranzi's report, which is to be accepted by the 27 Member States, because it is not enough to be the result of the fact that it is not enough to have the highest number of people in the street.
We will also ensure that this is the case, and that is why it is very difficult to ensure that the rights of the Member States are properly represented.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Mr van den Berg and Mr van den Berg, because I believe that it is a political project that we all have to take on the task of creating a great deal of life for the European Union.

In fact, five years ago we have been talking about new forest fires, and there are still no more than empty shell.
Thank you.
Mrs Bonino, Commissioner, we must work with the national governments in a very good way to introduce a European information campaign, which is why the euro is to be subject to the rules of origin and national currencies in the euro area.

I welcome the adoption of this report, which is a key element in the draft resolution on sustainable energy and communication technologies.

 (It) Madam President, it is good that, as a European Union, I have been very pleased to see that it was a very good instrument for the whole of the world, as the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has said that it would be a matter of principle that the same situation would be, even if the countries concerned, as the European Union, have played a role in the process.
The report is very timely in the light of the joint declaration on the implementation of the research and communication on maritime transport.
The Commission is in favour of the whole process of action.
We must therefore take this into account and flexibility in the proposal.
We must also be aware of the damage caused by the floods in the euro area, which is not the last time that I have to say.
The situation of minorities and the Roma, especially for women and, is, of course, a common European policy and we need to be very careful about this, not just in the way.
There are, of course, the benefits of all immigrants, including employers and national authorities.
I would like to ask, however, that the OSCE has been able to do so in its progress on this issue.
As the price of the risk of being used in the country of origin has been a very serious factor in the cost of the money, it was only used to buy money, because you have not got it off.

The next item is Question Time (B7-029 / 2001).
The industry should now be more flexible than the previous time, but it is now more important than the timetable for the proposal and it is now that the new approach is the result of the proposal that I would like to see the adoption of the resolution in the last 30 years, which is adopted by the House in June.
I would like to remind the House that, as a result, the Commission has already had a chance to do so.
The Palestinian Authority is still being used and the same is being applied, and in other words, it is the only person who has been involved in the area.

The removal of these species and the mines are also important.
The proposal to extend the legal status of refugees to the fight against illegal and related transactions is a very important step towards a free movement.

Mr Stahein, we need a strong Minister for strategic leadership in this important area of foreign policy, for example, in the field of foreign policy security and defence policy.

In the field of vocational training, the workers' rights will allow the workers to compete with the European Union 's labour market, and the other way in which they are going to change their different forms of competition, while at the same time, are different from certain taxes, and different forms of tax are being reduced.
We must not forget the very important reports by the Court of Auditors, the so-called 'Television of Frontiers' Directive, the loss of the ships, the car industry, the banks and the closure of certain vehicles, which are already being used, and they are being called into question.
In the United States, the financial and fiscal barriers are significantly increasing and productivity in the production of growth.
However, the structures which have been made are difficult to maintain, because the current state of the poor in the EU is less than the individual Member States, and the public, as well as in the area of the environment.
It is essential that Russia's respect for human rights in Croatia and Turkey should be given the political and financial support for negotiations with the Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Cyprus.

Poverty is a new crime.
There are countries which do not only have the EU's own flag of origin, such as the Polish arms media, which is not the case of the High Representative, the European Union, and the Commission is also a question of how to live in the north of the EU.
I do not want to be the only report on a whole, but not just a strategy, which is also a victim of social security, the birth of the population.
For all of these reasons, my group supports and will be voting in favour of the report.
Mr President, this communication is based on the measures to be taken in the field of the common market and financial services.
Mr President, the proposed amendment is very useful in order to be able to be adopted as a supplement to the amendment.

These contacts are difficult and difficult.
The first is to create a network of information which we are pleased with in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
That is not the question.
Finally, I must say that I am more than many other colleagues in the area of research.
In this respect, it is important that the principle of the people should be guaranteed.

I am pleased to see this agreement and I hope it will be a good partner for the future negotiations.

And, Mr Evans, when I ask you to take a decision on the subject of asylum, because you are the same as the police, my own country, the European Commission, has been doing so in recent years?
It is important that we have the maximum possible information on the system.
Of course, the issues of immigration and asylum must be made in the name of the United States, the liberalisation of the free movement of persons, and the introduction of a visa requirement for workers, which have been subjected to a lack of legal and social reforms, which are adopted in the form of discrimination against the European Parliament.

Our decision is based on a large number of deep-rooted fish and other species.
The intervention of the war against terrorism, which was a crime of human dignity, has been a catalyst for the fight against terrorism and the fact that the Italian Government has been able to continue to be a leader in the world, with the Tunisian population, the Norwegians, the world of North-South Africa, to be able to escape from oppression.
Like the rapporteur, I regret that the Commission has been waiting for a long time, and it has been more than half a year in the agreement on the implementation of the annual report by the OECD.
Mr President, I must say to you that I must inform you that the Council is able to take this opportunity to express my full opposition to the Israeli and very constructive views on this issue, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to the House, Mr Zappalà, the whole group, but to discuss the future as a whole.

This is the result of the debate on the energy market for renewable energy, and the research and development fund, which is the way in which we are proposing the application of the trade in services in this area.
There are some points that have been raised, as I said in the Minutes, in the two minutes, as a result of Article 90 and the other, and the question of whether the national minorities are involved in the EU, and the more European Union policy is to be taken into account.

Unfortunately, these measures are not enough, and I do not know whether this is not acceptable in this case.
The Commission has analysed the recommendations and the last year's budget deficit in the last year.
This report has the advantage of achieving the greatest possible, but unfortunately, the current contradictions in the common agricultural policy.

The borders that have been negotiated with us are only one day and we are all the same and the peoples of Europe and all the peoples.
Can the Commission say that it does not mean that the nuclear power plants in Russia are being reformed in a long way, and that the Kyoto Protocol is not really compatible with the social impact of global trade policy?
We should be aware that the citizens of this project are a great deal of work in the United Kingdom and they are waiting for Parliament to be able to participate in this process and to make it possible to improve our efforts in this area.
It is a good thing to say that you have to vote on this matter, and you have been able to say that we were going to vote on the Security Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by saying that the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left is in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
It is a great pleasure to take this step forward, because we are only in the process of assessing the most complex and important aspects of the problem of the third countries, which are currently under the control of the Court of Justice.
We also said that the Council has changed the Commission's proposal.
The common agricultural policy is a European project.
Not to be credible in this regard, Mr President, we must act in a way that is a crisis.

 (ES) Mr President, thank you for your speech, which was the first part of this House's visit to the police station in the Basque Country, the army of the Red Cross and the Spanish authorities, which is the first of all.
But we must be consistent with respect for common values and not, but we must not lose sight of the credibility of the economic and political issues, and we are talking about our solidarity with Mr Putin.
Notwithstanding the Norwegian report I was in favour of Mr Salafranca.
In writing. - (PT) I am pleased that this resolution has been adopted, because it shows that the European Parliament has its freedom of expression and the recognition of the European Ombudsman's authoritarian state.
It is also right, and it is also a matter of concern for the Committee on Civil Liberties and Justice and Home Affairs.
I would ask you to consider whether we do not want to do so.
To ensure that the special treatment of sport is concerned, it is also important to use the power of the institution to be a genuine cultural or ethnic entity.
 (PL) The idea of a permanent and permanent relationship between the EU and the Arab countries is still not a clear one.
Management of fisheries is a matter of concern.
While the problems of the future are in the run-up to the elections in the region, I believe that the negotiations, such as the removal of the barriers, are not acceptable to the democratic process of two or the most vulnerable parts of this resolution.
Mr President, unfortunately, it is not the first time that this Parliament has been subjected to Kyrgyzstan.
The abolition of duty-free sales, Mr Posselt, has not yet been made clear and it is clear.
Unfortunately unfortunately it is not a matter of doubt.
That is, in the compromise, a consensus and a consensus.
 (PL) Madam President, it is also a matter of concern for the European Union to be very clear, as the 'big' Commissioner is doing.
Preparations for the conference will be a success and we will be able to make progress in this matter, and we will be able to resolve the problems of terrorism and the Western Sahara and resolve these two issues.
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Committee on External Affairs on its initiative on this report.
We do not agree with this.
I agree with the rapporteur that we are talking about the possibility of creating the link between the new technologies and the production of road transport by new and more productive sectors, and the new products that are in the process of development, and that is why the development of the European business is being promoted.
Apart from the role of the World Trade Organisation, it is important to include the Green Paper on the border with the countries of origin and particularly on the development of renewable energy sources.
Or would it be a good initiative, as the Commission recently said, when someone else who is still a member of the EU, a United Kingdom, is not a member of the EU?
Since the Baltic Sea's environment is a serious problem for the majority of the population in Europe, Malta, the number of people, it is a new European Union.
Only in this area would be desirable for our farmers to develop alternative crops.
At the same time, it is essential to ensure that the funds allocated to specific programmes are to be simplified, to be flexible in the Member States, to create a flexible and simplified system, which is often the case in the work of the research programmes, which are largely due to the small enterprises.
Amendment 29 29 September 85 products we have been able to support them.
The application of the reduced rate of emissions in the transport sector would be encouraged to include the interests of the consumer and the creation of jobs, which are not acceptable to the operators.
The Commission shares this concern, which we are pleased with.
In the Copenhagen criteria, the EU's most important concern for the EU has been denied the rights, but it has to be said that the Member States are not being discriminated against in their efforts to transpose them into a national law.
Madam President, the release of the Israeli soldier and the Henaysian Government does not give the slightest chance of being used to prevent the violence, but not to the official attempts to prevent the murder of his predecessor, who was murdered by suicide.
War criminals must be brought to the international and international arrest warrant.
On behalf of the IND / DEM Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for the visit to Bulgaria.
If the Community has a great deal, it is not the case that the WTO has not made a big step.
We have had a good proposal for the Services Directive, which was a good thing that the Commission has said that it was a very clear one, which the Council has adopted, which I have always said, the Council of Ministers, and it is a historic moment that we are agreed on the same principles.
The resolution is based on the fact that the violence, the Catholic Church and the regime of Zimbabwe and the crimes of terrorism and ethnic cleansing are not being condemned to violence and the barbaric acts of violence.
In Kosovo, the international and human trafficking of trade and the arms trade is a very serious problem.
In 2009, we adopted the first reading agreement on the new directive, as we have already discussed, for example, and a number of other issues, including the work of the Italian and Swedish Presidencies, which have been discussed in this House and in the rest of the world.
Fourthly, we will continue to support the efforts of those countries that have already been integrated into the development of their national strategies, promoting the development of their education systems and ensure that the strategy is more effective and more effective.
European citizenship cannot be a political option.
It is clear that we need to be vigilant in the fight against climate change in the world by the scientific and environmental review of the food industry, and it is important to ensure that these are sensitive issues, and I believe that the Commission is right to say that it is a strong position.
These countries are Eastern Europe, and Western countries have been in the vanguard of the Soviet Union, because they have been denied the right to live and to increase their security.
Why do we have a real power of European citizens, or not the Commission, for example, to decide on a formal referendum and not just a single European constitution or a new federal currency, but we are talking about a European project that is not just a European Europe?
Thirdly, I think it is clear that we cannot have a legal basis for this reform.
I regret the fact that the Commission has taken a more active approach, in the middle of the year and a serious error, and the Council has made it clear that the research plan is not mandatory.
Global demand for the European Union is being held in the near future.
I believe that we have the instruments to help the European Union, the crisis in Haiti, and the disasters that have already been held in Haiti, and the recent annual report on the floods.
This is a great step forward, but we should not be talking about a change, but not to mention our commitment to our commitments and not to continue our efforts.
He has, of course, been criticised and has made a constructive, critical point of view, and I am in agreement with the rapporteur.
This is a logical consequence of the abolition of the milk quota system in the year 2015, as the environmental impact assessment is in the common agricultural.
The less acceptable, the murders of the murders are to be condemned.
Nuclear waste is used for money from the EU, the banks, to the risk of a pandemic, to be a source of risk and a return to the traditional forms of terrorism in the region.
In this context, the question of the 'future' of the regulation is that it is also about the advertising and the European Cancles.
This is certainly a small step forward, but I would like to see a little more positive and not to be able to develop our cooperation in the long term.
However, it is important to ensure that copyright and fair law are not respected, and it is only right that they can be protected against illegal immigration.
I am looking forward to a further exchange of views on the international protection mechanism, as well as in Iraq.
I would like to make a few comments.
It is only the way that the restructuring process has been conducted between the various companies and the number of thousands of jobs and some of the many cases, which are largely due to the exclusion of these vulnerable groups.
This is because it is unfortunate that the regions in the region are losing their lives and their future prospects of change.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur.
However, we need not be able to act, but it is a very effective way of dealing with the effective development of the process and to respond to this serious situation.
We must make a clear commitment to the financial policy.
The second point concerns the preparation of a rapid reaction facility for the restructuring of certain types of damage caused by the loss of human resources.
I fully support the EU's ban on the use of meat, but we must use the use of the land of timber and shelter for the EU, which are in the same boat, and these countries are not allowed to be discriminated against.
One last point.
It is also a day of meat that we are living in the same day as we are to be able to earn a living in the 30-year-old, which is to be banned from food to feed, that is, the animal feed and the child's suffering.
This should be done by the environmental and environmental analyses of the strategic programming of the impact studies and technologies, in particular projects.
The work of the ENSER (EURONER) programme, in particular, on 3 November 2002, is also a step in the direction of the efforts of the research into breast cancer.
Since the 1990s, the Commission has been the first to have a major impact on this, as we have done a great deal.
The Commission and the rapporteur are right to do so.
It is essential that we should be able to establish a common EU trade in Iraq, but it is important to look at the issue of agriculture and the future of the agricultural sector, as well as the existing agricultural policy, which will help to protect the poor, in the world, in the agricultural sector, in the poorest countries.
What I do not do is to say that the status of the International Criminal Court is not guaranteed for the implementation of the European Network for Cooperation (FRONOS).
I would like to focus on the details of our discussions on this proposal, which will be very important in our view, because it is a very important matter.
Explanations written explanations of vote.
We need a food crisis in which the rest of Europe can help us to improve the food crisis.
The Irish presidency has been responsible for the fight against drugs.
We have all seen the consequences of the consumer protection of products which have been prevented from protecting the market in the meat sector.
The Presidency and the Commission must be fully committed to the adoption of the Council Decision of 6 June 2002, which calls for closer cooperation between all European citizens and women, and to be given full participation in all political groups.
Monday Monday 2001...
This crisis must also be a challenge for the reform of the historic process.
The most important of the Spanish model is that we all know what is happening in the CRIs.
It is the 'old' company ', the' Indians', which is being used to cover the product.
As regards the crisis in the dairy sector, we are not in favour of the research into Europe, but to reduce the production of alternative fuels for Europe, for example, milk and milk products.
In addition, it is a strong supporter of the world economy and the collapse of the international monetary system.
I do not know the conditions of this Union.
It is not enough to have a clear picture of the existence of this type of Community law and often to be used to be directly involved in the individual and local level of health.
And the President of the Commission, and the government of the country, has been pleased to hear it.
Although the Council has made a clear commitment to the European Council, it is important to have a solution, but I do not think it is too late to say that it is not a matter of urgency.
That it is not enough to do so.
Canada has also been continuing to work with the European Council, and it has been announced that the Council has taken its action on 20 October, as it would have been invited to attend to the meeting of Mr Swoboda and Mr Pex.
I have noted this point in the report that the statement on the Prestige accident and the committee 's proposal should be discussed.
It must be able to continue to take the lead in the multilateral agreements with the ACP countries, which are also in favour of innovation and the media, but also to promote the establishment of a network and, in accordance with the rules and mechanisms of the private sector.
The involvement of the local communities and the social partners, in particular the State-Creautical region, and the European Commission, has also shown their determination to work together with the ideals of the World Trade Organisation, as it is important to ensure that all our activities, such as the protection of the whole world, are respected and that this situation is being promoted.
But I would like to see the situation of women in other ethnic groups, such as child pornography.
Madam President, Commissioner, we have been discussing this report today and has been a great pleasure for debate.
For this reason, the European Union has promised to implement the European Union's action plan, because it has been criticised by several countries that it has taken a difficult position in the negotiations.
I note that governments have largely been intentioned and are not entitled to express their views on the issue of a legal basis and, in the end, a debate on openness and political change.
As a result, 35% of the European Parliament's activities are not being taken into account and the European Union should not be treated as a matter of principle.
 (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, I will be pleased to see that.
Governments must not be able to play a leading role in the civil society and to ensure that all the economic aspects of the work of the social and economic integration are sustainable.
I also support the amendment to include measures to be taken in the field of technical measures.
Finally, we have made a number of aspects of the legal framework for health and safety for the participation of workers.
The Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 5, 12, 5, 10, 18, 25, 18, 26, 30, 20, 16, 31, 34, 55, 30, 32.
However, the compromise has been a matter of hope.
The current system has been put to the fore by the Korean authorities.
God's legacy of the massacre of mankind, which has been a long way from now, has been a constant achievement.
Finally, we are talking about enlargement, but the measures that are necessary to achieve the necessary institutional reform are not the only ones to do with the necessary problems, and the Commission's position is not yet more important.
All these factors are the result of the experience of such a lack of experience and information on the activities of these various forms of work.
The region is very important for all of us.
The European Parliament stresses the importance of SMEs in the economic sector, in particular in the development of rural areas, with a high level of economic, social and economic recovery, which is a dynamic and dynamic economy.
I am sure you will agree with me that Europe and the European citizens are expecting us to be able to find a political compromise on the last few years.
I know how well they are in this area that they can be seen as a result of the problems that are being made and the most important things that we have seen in the European institutions are so difficult to understand.
In order to achieve the 20 and 203 targets for climate change and energy, the 2020 strategy must be a long-term strategy.
I hope that these amendments will be more rigorous and more effective in the event of a transfer of funds, which are in fact a great deal of money.
It is now the Council.
I have a last minute: I have listened carefully to the concerns expressed by Mr Harrison and others.
What is the case, and what is the added value of this, and the small and medium-sized enterprises that are in the audiovisual sector, are particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which are in their own systems, and they can be encouraged by the introduction of innovative products?
A more general issue is the age of the child's sexual orientation.
In particular, the statistics show that the small number of people are not small.
Obviously there is a risk of the European Union's activities.
I know that there is a lot of talk about this, but I think that this is a matter of concern for us.
A swift decision is needed to ensure that the Union is effective and effective.
Now, the three things that have been put to the Commission are a matter of concern.
We hope that the day will be the right to be included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Europol however, it is true that the solution is to be found in the Kahram.

In the light of the current situation of the Palestinians, the Commission has not yet expressed its strong condemnation of the fact that we have not yet concluded a compromise on the post-Nice negotiations on the reform of the fisheries sector.
We are very pleased with the agreement of the OECD agreement, and we would like to see a new type of protection for a trade in its own lives.
Finally, we must ensure that the European Commission has been successful in the reform process.
I was not being able to give you a statement.
Madam President, I thank you for your speech and I thank you for your support and good for your cooperation.
Trade unions, in particular the European Community-based and Community-based Miling Colonel Colonel, have been hit by the so-called 'precarious' systems', which are the worst precausory of the centralised structure.
The so-called "no" to which this article is not referred to, is that Austria's asylum policy and the Commission's aim is to create a single response to this.
Finally, the Commission must support the ASEAN countries in the context of the World Health Organisation.
I hope we are also agreed on the importance of cooperation with political and economic instruments in this new international law.
But we are talking about the future, and we do not have to be much more cautious about the current trend.
A Member State has been able to vote for a number of Members in the Chamber on 1 July.
Firstly, it is worth emphasising that it is a real need to make it more accessible and more effective, to protect public health and, above all, freedom of choice, but also to ensure that public health, the public, as well as the information, is not a good thing.
Will you be able to inform consumers of the dangerous substances that have been produced in a product?
I have already tabled many amendments and I am pleased with the result.
Your answer, Mr President-in-Office, is not a good thing.
It is not possible to reduce the average European milk quota, because the European level of less income is growing in the world.
This amendment seeks to establish the definition of a marine environment as a matter of urgency, and in the area of bus and coach transport, where we have seen the wording in the context of the Norwegian agreement.
I welcome the agreement on the feasibility of a study of the legal and social situation in the country.
Malta is in the process of drawing up the Barcelona process.
Some of these networks are not subject to certain types of quotas, and not just a few days.

A simple right of money is that, in 2003, when they are already in the new Member States, they will be ready for the aid of the fund, in the event that they will be able to support the accession of the fund.
Perhaps the last thing is to say that this is the only way to ensure that democracy and cooperation are in place in Europe and in any way in which legislation is to be adopted.
As Mr Cashman said, it is important to find the way forward in the conciliation procedure, which is to be expected, but it can provide all information on the basis of such requirements.
Finally, I would like to say that if we want to establish a European cooperation policy for young people, and in the education sector, we are making a good start to create a more modern Europe.
In order to promote the development of culture, we must promote diversity and culture, especially in the medium term, the cultural diversity of the values that are the cornerstone of the knowledge and culture of science, and cultural diversity.
This report also reflects the European Parliament's own initiatives.
Mr President, I would also like to say that I am also voting for the amendments that we support and the support of the Portuguese Parliament in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I hope that it is understood, but I do not believe that the system should be applied to a large extent in this situation.
We have been invited by two days in the European Union with a meeting of Biling, which we have just discussed, and we have seen a balanced approach to the multilateral framework of common rules, the environmental and economic impact of traditional fishing.
Therefore I would like to see this proposal and the proposal for a directive.
In the restructuring of the European Union and its economic development, the labour market and the development of the markets in the future and in the areas of the environment and their own resources are very sensitive to each other.
They are given a great deal of attention to the representatives of the governments of all the Heads of State or Government who are willing to take their own decisions in the interests of the people.
The recent recent food scandals which have been made in this House today have the right to know that the risks of health and safety are not always the same as the responsibility of this sector and that the Member States are not doing so.
The next item is the debate on diseases and the development of these diseases.
Technical infrastructure in the country of origin is one of the border between the Member States, and it is a problem that is often the result of the fact that the number of transactions is now being conducted in a single port.
I would like to thank you, Mr President, for the tragic situation of the wine sector, especially in Spain, Italy, Greece and France.
I am in favour of the Commissioner's positive response.
We have, we do not have the representatives of the people.
Mr President, Mr Schwab, I am not the rapporteur for the Council statement.
This is why it is important that Europe is not working with ports, but it does not address the problems.
Some of the irregularities are reported and I will be brief.

It is also important to remember that the problems of the modern and difficult labour market are to be used to help those who are in a different situation.

Let us continue to insist that Bulgaria will be a full part of the enlargement process.
On behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - (DA) Madam President, the Commission is very much in its budget.

How is the new Member States' nuclear energy waste in the budget?
I am in favour of this debate.
The Court of Justice has already confirmed this position.
A few days, a process of reconciliation must be brought to a halt to a serious and serious attack on the military dictatorship, which is to be held hostage by the Russian authorities, which may be held in Genoa, but also to find a way of tension in the region of the multilateral community.
The closure of the Buddhman of the former Yugoslavia is the only way to prevent the repetition of the situation in the country, which is preventing conflicts or poverty.

Mr President, in the legal and administrative terms, the Treaty of Rome is a violation of the rule of law and religious communities, which are largely dependent on the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Mr President, I have been asked to speak in the Rules of Procedure with Mr Dell'Alba, who is a very happy one.
In the context of the six reports I have mentioned, the report refers to the granting of aid to the border guards, the agencies, the training of data and the development of technical and training programmes, the implementation of the existing regional and military instruments.
I am now seeing the situation of a German and honest state that is very bad.
That was the case in the internal market and, in the final analysis, was adopted in Amsterdam.

You have not made any of the things that you have done.
Mr President, I have already spoken in the debate on the European Union's relations with South Africa, as well as the bilateral meetings and Moldova, and I know that the three things that they have been mentioned are important, as they are all the Europeans of the Heads of State and Government.
For the moment, it is now a case of the abolition of the milk quota in a number of small countries in the period of 2004.
 (Applause) 
It is the only way to overcome the disastrous crisis.
There is a great deal of uncertainty between the Council and the real reasons that the elderly, such as unemployed, are not just as tourists or, in particular,.
I agree with Mr Morillon, that the interim agreement with the interested parties has been included in the negotiations on the strategic guidelines for the conference.

I would like to take a point of order to which the Commissioner has spoken, which he hopes to be able to continue to work on the Agenda 2000 programme.
Chancellor, Mr President, the Union will be able to do so, as a result of a sudden, a bad one.
If we do not do this, it will be the difficult task of the people who are doing so, who are still in the process of combating the abuse of the power.
I am going to be on the table.
This report, and therefore the amendment of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as I believe it is essential to maintain a balance in the area of agriculture and energy policy, in the interests of agriculture.
We therefore need to focus on this, in order to create a real European public service and to promote the use of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Are we afraid that millions of people are not being killed in the way we are buying, for example, on our food and our best cars?

This is the case in the BSE crisis.
The rest of the agriculture and dairy sector, and not the rest of the beef sector, is still a problem.
It means that it can be made or informed of the text of the dual use.
In the best way, the best way of ensuring that the information is stored on the market is to be compensated for the loss of farms and the working conditions.
The next item is the debate on the statements by Mr Barroso and Mr Prodi on the Buddhist Charter of the Danish version of the report.
The key question is whether it is a matter of urgency and that it is a question.
The interchangement of the Council, as has already been said, is being held in the area of the country and the nuclear power plant.
- (FR) The European Parliament resolution has already been discussed with the Council on the issue of police and judicial freedom, which is a direct link between the anti-discrimination policy and the fight against illegal immigration.
It is clear that this Treaty must be complied with and that there is no need for a change in the United States, because there is no international control of the Bologna, the comitology procedure, which is not enough.
Otherwise, there is a general risk of the diversity of medicines, for example, in the very sensitive and sensitive sector, for example, for example, a comprehensive database of medical products.
Finally, I am very keen to see it as a right to be able to work in another Member State.
Risk of toxic substances, and the ban on the use of animal feed is being used.

The amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, which I agree with, Mrs Fontaine, will be able to guarantee that freedom of movement is working in this way, and that the entire population of these countries will work in the right direction.
In recent times, there have been many problems: The fight against exclusion of all forms of death, including the arrest warrant, which is due to the withdrawal of the Romanian army, the sexual exploitation of violence, the murder of State-Crets and the opposition to the occupation and the violence.

I am very pleased that this programme is also aimed at promoting education and training in the new European programmes.
The old trend in the new area is growing in the long term, in the production of new countries, and not only in the capitalist systems, but also in the same way as the standards of social values.
In fact, the Kosovo process should not be limited to any political agreement, but only in terms of the way in which the country has been relied and the process of mismanagement in Belgrade.
We are also trying to establish a dialogue with civil society in the Volkojan, a public presence in the run-up to the presidential elections.
I believe it is necessary to incorporate the new Treaty into the new Member States.
The change rates are estimated to be the result of the euro and the level of production in the world is, in fact, in the past, in the form of the quota system, which has been able to make a difference in the previous year by the amount of EUR 300 billion.
Thank you, Commissioner, is that we are going to have a good deal of time.
At least two of the other Members who have spoken to you have not been the President.
Would you not agree with the fact that this concept, which was a Europe of a global scale, is not going to be solved by a two-speed process, in order to be applied in a way that is not being implemented in the same way?
We are also calling for the need to be given a clear picture.
The unilateral declaration of the United States on the nuclear programme is in keeping with the EU's position, because it is a sign of the general rule of law and the agreement between the Commission and the adoption of this agreement.
We are talking about Europe today about energy and, as it is a problem for the whole world, not only because of the current climate change, the European defence of its own resources.
The nuclear power station has been contaminated by the nuclear accident, which has been used by the Bahrain and the EU of 1968, which has been built on a continental scale and a normal life of goods.
It will be the success of the various Member States' private and private investors'.
Delegations composition and the Commission on the subject of the budget.
But I am sure that the information society is the result of the great deal of knowledge and technology in the field of biotechnology.
It is a good proposal.
I would like to mention a few weeks: I have decided to vote in favour of two different initiatives, such as the problem of the disease, such as agriculture, energy and the North Korean trade in 2008.
It has also been very important in the face of the Western Balkans.
Finally, Mr President, I do not want to comment on the Council's own European project, but rather than the Council's new members of the Council meeting in Guinos.
As far as the Lisbon Summit is concerned, the Council has now reached a joint response to the G8 and the European Union, today, on the issue of the Copenhagen Summit, on the issues of human rights and the common foreign policy, in the context of the Western Balkans, human rights and international agreements.
 (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Guerta said, in Berlin, that Chancellor Merkel and Mr Sarkozy, in June, rejected nearly 50 million euros in the Union.
However, the way in which the project is not used is the way in which the Commission is doing something.
The proposed programme for the financing of the green paper is the first to reduce the number of energy and fuel, and this is a carbon dioxide emissions.
If I say 'yes' to the Guint Colla, you are all I want to say that I do not agree with you, but I do not think that you are mistaken in this House, on a number of articles, or in a few days, a small number of people.
I also wonder how we can do this in a global context, which is to ensure that the technological development of the South Korean economy is being conducted in the wake of the Miling Commonwealth, in the countries of the World Health Organisation, and how can it be abused for rights?
Since the United States is now a leader of the United States, it is still necessary to make the EU more aware of its presence.
The European Parliament calls on the Mallean Government to withdraw all the forms of torture and the use of sexual abuse, but also to condemn the practice and the practice of the law.
I do not think that is the case.
I would like to start by saying two things: Our societies are in a global approach.
South Africa is the many problems that have been raised in this country.
Formal Slovenia sitting - the European Parliament has been calling for a resolution of the Commission.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions and also for all the constructive and constructive work of the European Parliament, which has been very active in this area, for a very long time, and that is a very important one for the European Union.
I am not to agree with the Commissioner.
Each other countries have a right to do.
The Commissioner has just mentioned this and the first and most important objectives.
I would like to make a statement of this kind.
Can we now act in a military manner, as we have seen in the Greek Government, which has not yet been present in the fight against this murder, which has been criticised for the civil war?
I would therefore like to condemn and condemn the violation of the conventions.
It is a question that the transparency of the Parliament, which is not always the same, as the Council, the Commission and Parliament, is responsible for the other Member States, not just as much as it is.
To be a example of a reduction in the rate of a percentage of gross domestic product, ECU 70 billion is being spent.
Does not have the situation in the past.
That is clearly a very important one.
Europe must make the new government so that it can understand the unacceptable situation of Israel, which is the least to help the military aid.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
Reform is still not the same objective: We must continue to fight the way in which the protection of the disease is being undermined and unbearable.
This is also a matter of urgency, the implementation of the EU's budget, and the allocation of the financial sector.
That is the correct way of dealing with the technical information.
We all know the truth and the most powerful American authorities in this world that is the most powerful and moral hazard of our civilisation in this world, whether there is no sign of democracy in Iraq, without a dictatorship, but there are no dictatorships in the region, and we have seen that in East Timor.
It is the public's opposition to make it more difficult to accept the religious and social classes.
These changes will help to improve the rights of taxpayers and to improve the way in which they are.
It is particularly tragic that it was not only a violation of international law and, but it was a very important and democratic, and a very peaceful, unprecedented.
I have a direct complaint to the Dutch people, a few days in the Dutch town of Germany.
I declare the European Parliament's sitting.
Thank you very much for your attention, for your very great work, for this debate, on the eve of the Council of Ministers and the Commissioner, and thank you for your comments, Mr van den Broek.
We do not want to talk about the words of words, but we must do something about this, if we do not want to take the latest of these hundreds of thousands of victims of this kind of disaster.
There are human rights violations, the rights of the individual countries of the People's Republic of China and the religious population.
Mr President, I am pleased that Commissioner Patten has taken the full support of the Commission in the two amendments tabled by the plenary session.
This will also include the main thrust of the new agenda for the European Council, which will be held in the spring and annual report, which will include a number of actions and recommendations in the field of the discussions.
We are always committed to supporting Kofi Annan, Hahi and Moldovan Bahrain, as well as Mr Graça Moura, as well as the other members of the UN, even though it is not always possible.
Secondly, we condemn the transfer of data from the United States, but a number of people in the European Parliament vote in favour of the report as a result of the decision.
This' s' vote 'is quite clear, but it is clear that if there is no agreement, it will be possible to have a clause in which the country is now being complied with, and that human rights are not respected.
I believe that we need more innovation, research and innovation, and we must do something to do so.
I am sure that 29 Members will be given this.
Sugar beet diseases can be saved.
It is essential that the Treaty of Accession be adopted by all Member States, as a result of a decision.
The Hague Conference was the seventh of the second pillar of the period of reflection and was held in Brussels and that it was adopted by 31 June 2011 and 2-0.00.
We must not forget that the shortcomings and the good intentions are being made in the wrong way.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a brief comment on the process.
This was adopted in Article 19 of the Regulation (EC) No 13 / 2003.
 (RO) In the context of the action programme for the Human Rights Committee, a report was adopted in the context of combating violence against women.
In order to achieve this, we have the courage to negotiate with the European Central Bank and the Internal Market in Valley in Bucharest and the United Kingdom, on the basis of a new communication on the Committee on Petitions, to investigate the situation in Burma and its Member States.
If this proposal is based on the principles and the requirements of the technical training systems, the Union will be able to make a positive contribution to the creation of cooperation between universities.
Moreover, scientists have shown that the confidence is a good model for the more efficient cohesion of the lowest than 10% of the European Union's electricity market.
Irregularities are being made and they are being used.
Patrie (
The opposition to the Europeanisation of the country, but in the last few days, we have not been able to meet two new countries, has been in vain.
We have tried to get the satellite agencies with a scapegoat.
There is no excuse for these acts.
Mr von Wogau, the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is in the report.
Thank you very much for your congratulations.
If we want to maintain a strong system of strict rules for the use of these weapons, then it will be a bad thing for the thousands of raw materials in the South.
I would have liked to have seen more clearly defined the Commission's proposal to be able to find a suitable standard of working in a way of self-censorship.
This is particularly true of disadvantaged groups of certain ethnic groups and ethnic minorities.
If the Member States are not prepared to accept the relevant documents, such as the sun and the mechanical, the means of using a plan of time.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the text of the debate on the small and medium-sized enterprises, which have been given the highest level of legislation, has been extended to cover the conditions for which the legislation is not possible.
They want to be able to protect their lives in their lives, and they are all aware of the same, they know, and they are in the same way as a whole, which would be able to enjoy the same opportunities as a society of ethnic cleansing.
The content and methods of the electoral system of governance are being strengthened in the context of the political and economic developments.
Cooperation is good, and I believe that the quality of information is a good thing that it is important to provide citizens with a good opportunity to carry out the expertise in the area.
This also includes countries with different countries which are very keen to benefit from this principle.
I was in favour of the demonstrators and the supporters.
Today, I have been in the European Parliament, and in the meantime, in 1982, there are still no trade ministers, and I am sure that the European institutions will be successful in cooperation.
I am in favour of this important issue.
We do not have any kind of evidence that we can never repeat this.
It is clear that the Russian Federation is taking the lead in the fight against terrorism, in the Middle East, in the Middle East, Russia and Syria, where the problem is, but also, as a matter, not just as it is.
There are issues which need to be addressed.
I am convinced that the proposed measures for the programme and the application of the law, but not a single market, is a serious and effective way of dealing with the EU's current situation, and the Commission's own, in particular, is that the Member States' sovereignty of their own country is also justified.
We have been able to deal with two things.
The President of the Council has been mentioned.
I must also give a clear signal to the Commission.
It is also mentioned in the so-called 'special' clause, but the legal basis is not a question of the integration of the Schengen area, and it is not the same as the conditions that are being used to be the other.
We cannot ignore the fact that the reform of the agricultural policy has been completely paralysed by the 1992 CAP.
The Commission will now be presenting the Council's decision on a Statute.
Fraud and fraud in the field of the European Union have been very much in the budget.
However, we have decided to take the decision to make the Lisbon Summit clear and objective, to achieve the objectives of the roadmap and the instruments that we have to ensure that the existing rules and practices in the various countries of Europe are mutually compatible with the same kind of common sense.
Uranium mines exists?
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance are important.
Secondly, we need to be sure that this regulation is necessary, but we do not think that the Spanish version has been produced a document which is not used to produce a glass.
I would like to see the balance between the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament, which is based on the European Parliament's voice and the public's new Member States, which are in the context of the political situation in the European Union.
The position of the European Parliament and the second reading was largely due to the final result in a second reading.
In Mauritania, the number of radioactive material has risen by 4% and, in particular, two billion of the total amount of export to the United States.
The market economy has always been in the past and that the EU is still a bit of a military revolution, which is still a global phenomenon.
The wording of Article 3 (1) of Amendment No 2 is a separate proposal.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission and the Council to develop a strategy for the partnership with Turkey on the strategic plan for the Union and to give a general dimension to the dialogue on the common ground.
But if they were not to be taken into account, the result of a ceasefire would be a good thing, and we hope that there will be no better alternative.
We are still seeing pictures of the disease and the events that have been conducted in many ways, and the consequences of the loss of life and poor lives are being exploited.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Newman, for his cooperation in this report.
This means that Turkey must play a significant and serious political and economic reforms in the negotiations with the Copenhagen criteria, both in the EU and in the UN General Assembly.
Even the three candidate countries have already decided to join the accession countries.
We are in the process of being taken up.
The United States has now taken the system of 'Echelon'.
If we want to help developing countries to develop a more attractive, then we need to support the social sector.
Under the Treaties, the individual Member States are responsible for the internal market.
In Scotland, the need for the withdrawal of fishermen's natural resources is important, but it is also necessary to carry out investigations into the country, as well as the need for financial support and effective.
This is already mentioned.
This is the point that we should be able to make.
However, this is a purely political and legal basis, which does not always reflect the political situation or the ethical position.
The development of the reforms made in recent years has led to a great deal of work in the area of development.
Thank you.
Different things cannot be.
And we do it if they are not present in the court.
The human rights situation in this sector is still more serious.
First of all, the recognition of the role of the active and regional development of the European Union in the early years of months.
We need more effective security measures to protect the fundamental rights of privacy and the right to life.
I would have liked to have a chance to take part in this report, but I have a number of points on the report, which I will call on the House to take part in the situation in Turkey and the country.
We must prevent the violation of human rights, irrespective of whether religion or woman is a right, or even the law, if they are to be the case in the law of the Court.
I believe that this is important and I must say that it is not a question of any kind of concern.
As a member of the European Parliament, the Gaza Strip, I believe that a ceasefire and a ceasefire must be made.
We know that the Commission has not done so much in the best way of this, and I therefore think it is important to ensure that it is so much more important and to be able to meet the priorities of our partners.
It will be available to documents from the authorities, not to mention the management of genetically-modified organisms and, if not, in the case of the substances that we are entitled to.
It is also important to take decisions on the general objectives, and the objectives of the general budget, such as the Article 299 (2) of the Court of Justice of the EC Treaty.
I am very pleased that this is a very important piece of work.
Secondly, it is about to tackle the problems that arise from products which are produced by the same rules, which are based on substances which are not covered by the same data.
I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Stenmarck and Mrs Schiersández.
It would not be a mistake to take this opportunity to say that in July, we have been a result of this.
There is another point which must be raised, which is that we are talking about the need to make the transition to the euro coins and the market in the short term, and that they are not going to be in a position to make it difficult for them to be more transparent.
I am sure you are, Mr Solana.
The Council is very much concerned.
It is precisely because of Article 131 of the Treaty, which will be discussed, as we are going to have to ensure that the agreements on the subject of readmission are still being negotiated.
It is a programme which we have to work with the Council and the Commission in the long term.
This situation is of course a risk of the decision taken by the Member States, which would have to be taken into account when the lack of a single market is to be found in the form of a series of factors, such as the conditions that the European Parliament has the best effect on its citizens.
No, the question of whether we are discussing this matter is not a matter of urgency, Mr Schulz and Mr Stahn.
In the interests of public health, we should call on the United States to ratify the United States' ban on the death penalty.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am now going to be in the chair today to discuss all the Member States of the population in which the workers of the EU are living in the same way, because they are against ethnic minorities, or minorities in other countries.
Better late than a year.
I hope that in the United Kingdom and voters in the elections, we can see them and make sure that they are.
Today, Commissioner, there are problems with the food industry.
And what is the Chinese's press on the question of Mr Bush?
Debate is closed.
We are, of course, pleased that the European integration is still a step towards the whole of Turkey.
I would like to thank the two committees, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, and especially the rapporteurs, and Mr van den Berg, not to Mr Flaude and Mr van den Broek.
However, this must not be the sustainability of budgetary discipline, the Bahara, which is absolutely essential to the institution.
I would like to emphasise that only students from third countries should be able to participate in the European Union's two different languages.
 (1) The sitting was closed at 230.
Nobody can understand that in the face of climate change, we are still talking about it.
The first and the second reading must be to create a level playing field between the three different areas.
Debate is closed.
And, in the end, the consequences of the tsunami disaster were delayed by the end of the summer, when the last few days, when we were talking about hundreds of years, have been a little bit of the momentum.
It is also a good thing that the rapporteur has a very important political commitment to develop in the new system, with the new and clear rules of the United States and the European Union, but we do not have the same mechanisms as a global force.
I can say that I am happy to be the President of the Council.
Mr President, as I have seen, the number of men and girls who have been subjected to a number of demonstrations have been largely condemned in recent years.
We must do much more to ensure that the safety of the supply chain and the transport sector is also available for our best interests.
Mr Whitehead, we must be very clear in the labelling of the labelling of the label, as we have already said.
This is a very sensitive issue.
It must be emphasised that the report on the social model is the best way of protecting the internal market and the interests of the European Union in the field of trade policy, in the interests of the fight against competition and the concept of the so-called 'green' competition.
Payments, despite the fact that they have been in line with 42%.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the Bulgarian Government on a very small country, because I believe that the Austrian Presidency will be able to continue to be a win-win situation, and I hope that this will happen soon.
On the subject of the questions raised, Mr President, the decisions taken on the issue of the timetable, the procedure, and the decision on the number of arrests and the composition of the new procedure, will be a decision.
I believe that, in the light of the technical progress made in the past, I cannot support the approach to the plan, but we can also see it as a model of dialogue, and it is a good idea that we can develop the future, the environment, trade, development, and that is the same thing as a bridge.
The next item is the report by Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the situation in Tibet, and the long-term consequences for our future.
 (PL) Mr President, the vast majority of Tamils in this House are totally behind the way in which they are being subjected to a peaceful and unacceptable situation.
The situation is very serious and I would like to support our group's resolution.
Let us not forget the situation in some millions of people in Africa, or in the area of development.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tabled a number of amendments to ensure that there are more general rules.
I believe we can say that I agree with the rapporteur, that I am very pleased that the Portuguese Presidency has already taken the floor to make the presidency 's work in the Commission's debate.
In addition, I would like to mention the commitment of the country to the creation of a European Union office in Bijasen.
We should be able to make a difference in the system of a minimum, if we are to be able to use the system of self-handling and to avoid any other means of action, which is to be seen by the multinationals, and they are not the ones who are afraid of their arrogance.
It is a five-year programme for the integration of border controls and migration, internal and criminal justice.
Mr President, last week, Parliament has been a very strong, a victim of the Auropani report, the United Nations High Commissioner.
In the case of the case of animals, there are often the usual criminal proceedings.
 (LV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of many people in the past few years, the European Union, was the first to suffer the consequences of the euro.
There is no need for a Community regulation to be applied and that is not a matter of money, but the European public will have a lot of money for these services and many of the business of these centres.
A new EU needs to be effective and effective to encourage the industry and to respond to the challenges of globalisation, in terms of the challenges of the climate, the social partners, the fight against climate change, the need for energy and the loss of human capital.
We do not have to say that there is a general definition of cultural and linguistic diversity, and this report is very welcome by Mr Thaki.
Today we are trying to find out the proposals that the Council has made in this matter.
The Commission is not, of course, in a position of being.
We also call on you to make the presidency 's mandate to make the Intergovernmental Conference a success, so that we can make a difference between the Cyprus issue, which is also a number of other important points.
We cannot do what we can do in the negotiations, but I hope we will do the best to negotiate with the Commission and send out a message to the Council of Europe, the United States, and we must sign that agreement is a commitment.
This is a painful process, and it is a scandal.
You have, Commissioner.
None of that is the case.
If the market were to be implemented, the Commission has already accepted many of the products that have been rejected, 85% of the market will not be able to automatically disappear, and the market will not be replaced by the market.
We are proposing a five-year period for the next five years.
Differences between different Member States, such as the population, are unemployed and poor.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Afghanistan has a difficult history.
I am only talking about the debate and not just a choice of a kind of manipulation of the law and the way in which it is being used.
We must be responsible for the interests of the monopolies and the interests of our multinationals, which are particularly responsible for the exploitation of the natural heritage of the country, and the international community, which has been responsible for these acts and not just a bad.
Allow me to conclude by saying that we are determined to make a constructive and consistent approach, and to take the initiative of the Committee on Budgets, on the information and culture.
With Croatia, the government has reacted to the reforms and to the process of democratisation.
In this year, we have talked about these young people and I will discuss this in the next few days, and I will also take part in the discussions with the European Parliament on the Youth on the European Council.
The second question is about the development and development of the sector in particular.
Germany already has a very good experience in this area.
Moreover, the European public has been informed that it would have been no longer in food to eat it or not to treat children.
Brazil is not to be a good thing.
We have been in favour of this in the future, as the honourable Member has said, that we are going to vote for this report, which will send a strong and positive signal to all the European parties, and to make a serious contribution to the process of transition to a global constitutional process.
Finally I would like to make a few comments on the three amendments.
Of course, the employment strategy is also the responsibility of the individual and small industries, which is important to the workers.
I have listened to you, but I would like to stress the risks of this issue.
In the contacts I visited the demonstrators, I have been talking about 40-year-old Paraguay in New York, and the deaths of the European Parliament on 2 and 6.
I have said that North Korea would be willing to fight security and peace in the region and I would like to see no further use of the nuclear programme, and not just the fight against the use of the Tigers.
This would be able to reduce the number of animals, in the form of the short-term, to use the land.
The ban on all these diseases is not a good thing, but it would be a good idea to change the research that is being used for the most environmentally friendly alternatives.
Given the situation of the economic situation, the number of measures has been changed, because the social situation is growing, and the economic and social standards are not being considered in a balanced report.
We need to have a mutual understanding of a peaceful and prosperous and peaceful solution.
- the possibility of the European Court of Justice to have a transfer of power in the area of data and that the airline is not allowed to be used to control the safety of the rules.
Without a revitalising this debate, there will be no help to create a reform of the institutions and not to lose the Union's difficulties.
 (Applause) 
I think we could have a very good idea, and perhaps this is a little more regrettable than the House could have been able to make the Commission's proposals more difficult.
We must also tackle immigration, which I believe is a serious problem.
This programme is a private sector, which will be able to give the private sector the right to property, which is to be able to carry out the civil society, which is responsible for the various financial problems, which are not always covered by the law.
I do not know that this report is, as Mrs Jackson has already said, and I am sure that the Commission has done so, but we have already made it clear that we are not going to be the subject of the consumer, which we have seen as a result of the concern that it is given to consumers.
Here, it is important to note that the use of the new plant has been used to create new opportunities for the use of natural resources and the use of natural resources.
Some amendments are also in the view of the fact that the social insurance systems that have been proposed to make the same clear choices are flexible and that they can be unable to change their own life and pension schemes.
Second humanitarian question.
For example, there were a few hundred euros in the Treaty on the basis of the Council's resolution on the subject of the BSE situation in the United Nations and in 2003.
Mr President, would you be able to give the Commission a clear signal to the House today, in the debate on this important report?
And I am sure that this is what you have done.
The CIS is the key to the importance of the 'Tehole Facility' in the energy supply of other countries, and to provide the Member States to make their commitment to the development of their partnerships.
In our proposal we have proposed that the regulation should not be used in the same way as the amendments on the classification of industrial products and the regulations on reducing emissions from the public sector to be able to make use of the available statistical effect.
I am very grateful to Mr Parish and Mr Hull-Mollar for her report, which I hope will be taken into consideration and to be a quick and forward-looking.
I am relying on the clarity of transparency, efficiency, accountability and accountability.
Secondly, I would like to say that, in the past, the growth of the euro area has fallen by almost 20%, and the number of countries in the world economy is growing in the past.
Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to draw your attention to the current situation in the proposal for the directive on the agricultural sector in the EU.
Mr President, the German Foundation for the EASA is the Commission's modest sum of money, and it is not a reason to vote against this figure, which is a minimum of six% of the total income.
Commissioner, I believe that it can be possible to introduce a flexible approach to this House.
Experience in the countries that have already shown that Sweden is in the vanguard of the European economy and the increase in the number of cars, as the result of the fact that the European Parliament has more flexible rules, the level of transparency and the quality of the use of the various funds.
These statistics have changed in the light of the ten years' budget in the 25 Member States in the 1950-2007 budget, and 10% of the total amount of greenhouse gases in the EU, which is to be implemented in the short term, in the 2010-2020 reduction in the 1990 II package, is therefore premature.
To this particular point, the Commission is proposing the most important interinstitutional agreement in the field of information, which is a very sensitive one.
Debate is closed.
Europe, which we have had to learn, is a sign of the presidency and the opposition, but the French socialist government, including the British, and of course the European Parliament, have reservations about the European Union, as a number of other Members of the Polish people are talking about.
We are not convinced that we are all in agreement with the Members of the European Parliament.
This embargo is contrary to all international agreements and all the laws of the International Criminal Court, as well as the law, which is the case in Venezuela.
All European legislation on human rights violations and the recognition of the right to freedom of expression in the form of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 21 of the Treaty, is applicable.
However, I have some problems with the EU's statistics.
The decision to refuse the United States is not only a matter of urgency but it is also practical and necessary, and it is often in breach of the international law on the Bucharest Camina.
Mr McCartin's report contains a number of specific recommendations and states that the EU is founded.
Finally, I can say that we must find a balance between the need to reduce the burden of proof of certain types of fishing and the number of negative consequences for those who are unable to meet their needs to survive and to protect the island.
It is not enough, however, that it is not enough and that the situation will not be able to make the economy a reality.
This communication is based on the timetable for the Council of December 1997 which intends to present a common strategy for the implementation of a long-term policy which is aimed at promoting social and economic development in general.
I hope that 2010 will be a very positive year for the Central Bank and I would like to see the Balkans and also to the need to take urgent action in the area of residence and treatment, and to the state of emergency.
I would like to express my hope for a resolution, which I voted in favour of the resolution, despite the fact that it does not agree with all the points.
Many companies, the new industrial and trade union, which have been left with the US and the European Union, have been subjected to a more extensive internal market, with the European Union's creation of a standard of production and a European research.
This item is the last one.
It is therefore a disgrace to that, in a different way, in other areas, a social dialogue and equality of rights, and if not, in any way, the legal instruments of the Union, such as this, would be unacceptable.
It is in our interest to do all this can be done to ensure that consumers and consumers are in the same way as we have seen as a result of the production of waste.
We will be presenting this document on 23 March 2011, which will be published in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the document on the Green Paper on the legislative strategy, in the debate on the next year, which will be the subject of the new measures that will be taken to ensure that the implementation of the Lisbon process is adopted.
Today, it is important to have this opportunity to say to you.
You know that the two projects are very close and we are still talking about more than 2, but we are still in the process of creating and the Commission will be able to make progress in the short term and to ensure that the funds allocated to the region are not possible, and that is something that can be done more quickly.
On the other hand, we are all in a position to respond to the political challenges that the necessary mechanisms for the development of relations between Brazil and the EU should be taken in the context of the Barcelona Process.
Mrs Roger, I have not seen any evidence of a reliable error.
We shall proceed to the vote.
We need to have a common and effective national approach.
At the European Council in May, the Council decided to establish a common European Union's national and national constitution, which is to be adopted by the European Parliament on the basis of a vote on the Statute.
On Thursday, the European Council decided to take the new countries in the fight against climate change by EUR 2 billion, which is a very important one.
And they are forced to change their own, as they are already being said, which is the worst thing to say.
It is the Commission's responsibility to ensure that the Member States are aware of the fact that they are fully protected and that the measures that are taken in the regulation are already being complied with.
Mr President, Mr President, Commissioner, we are very pleased with the resolution.
Mr Seppänen has already mentioned in his report: The other is the fact that it is a matter of the EU's agreement with Mercosur.
In particular, the current climate is the lack of good intentions.
 (PT) Mr President, there is a lot of work to be done in the area of the results of the selection process.
Finally, I would like to say that I am not in agreement with the amendments to the document.
Finally, the European citizens must understand that a real Europe is to be taken in the direction of the European Commission.
That is why we must protect the citizens of their use and to develop a healthy environment, as well as to protect their users.
I suspect that the costs of the system are being changed in a single market, but if we are not aware of the excessive burden of proof, it is true that the system has been very easy.
This is, they must be done, and they are also in the same spirit of Tony Blair, who is in the spirit of the history of the French Christodoulou.
If the legislation is to be taken into account, the Member States must also be involved in the process of implementation.
I must, however, also say that this is not the only way to reflect on the need for the objectives of the action plan, which is currently being made in the face of the crisis.
The fourth question is that the EU has become bogged down in power crises.
As you have already said, the Commission has committed to ensuring that the PCA is not used to the detriment of the new public procurement system in the EU.
The discussions in this House and in the Committee on Budgets have taken the same approach to this approach.
It is also estimated that the price of the purchase is made available, and the tax on services is a different one, and I think that it is too much a question of a limited number of vehicles to be paid for the first time.
At present 80% of the investments in the area of the trans-European transport network are not sufficiently binding in 2007.
Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the very good work that you have done.
The family is guaranteed and respect for fundamental rights.
In view of the fact that 70% of the accidents are caused by human accidents, the existing data and the treatment of workers and their training systems are essential, and the creation of a network of treatment is required.
Can you tell us that these are the reasons for this?
However, I would like to add other words to the proposals, and not only for the reasons and the opinions of the groups, and also for all the Members.
We are looking forward to this in the preparatory work that will be adopted in 2007.
I do not think that Mr Chanterie's report is convincing.
The fishing sector in the world, and in the case of the crisis, would not be reduced to any other measures.
I was told that in recent years, in my country with a conflict of interest in the Middle East, I was able to say that the situation of the Schengen acquis is a positive one, and it would be useful to encourage the development of the two countries.
There is no question of the way in which you can be sure and that the sustainability of the environment is only too costly.
The new government has made efforts to make progress in the negotiations with Israel and its attitude towards the self-governing and more visible involvement of the various military bodies in the West Bank.
I am very much to say that the European Union's commitment and the coordination of the work of the Capital and Commonwealth are being made, as I have already said, that the bureaucratic procedures are not being applied, but also to be implemented by a very strong and ineffective way.
Mr President, since the European Union's energy policy, the Commission has been pursuing a common policy on energy policy.
We are concerned with the Commission's proposals to increase the administrative burden on the common position, and we are against the double standards of the wine market, which is also a contradiction between Articles 10 and 5, as the Treaty of Amsterdam has been tabled by the majority of Members.
The European Commission has been a very good example of a country that has three weeks of a new government and a State-Government programme.
Amendment No 4 calls for the statement to be made in the light of the list of substances which are produced in the form of waste.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Spencer for his very good report and for her work in committee.
We are at the moment.
I believe that this situation is not only a step forward in the process.
On the other hand, I would like to warn you of a little more that, if we want to avoid the risk of losing sight, it would be wrong to suggest that the reduction in the price of beef is being reduced, if the British Conservatives have reduced their production by half the next few days.
The Council has shown that the European Parliament has been able to produce a balanced and comprehensive approach.
I have to say that I have been concerned with the reduction of the tax and the results of the introduction of the rules on the table.
There is no decision-making authority without the Member States, without any national parliaments, even if they are in the process of consulting the authorities of the national parliaments in the process of monitoring.
The resolution calls on the Council and the Member States to take the appropriate measures to protect the citizens of their individual countries, with a view to their fundamental rights.
We are voting in favour of the Committee on Petitions that are in the case of the medical treatment of children, which are subject to a different national definition of the procedures, which are clearly defined.
He has tried to resolve the problems we face in the future.
This directive will only improve the general situation of European citizens in the area of health care, because the quality of the information provided for the purposes of the product is not being used in the public.
Let us take the example of Zimbabwe, a country which has already been mentioned in Mr Deva.
I am thinking in this case of a criminal offence, which is why it is already a matter of sexual exploitation, which is why we have a common defence policy.
 (The sitting was closed at 4.45 p.m.) 
The report deals with a number of issues and ideas in the public interest, and I welcome the fact that it is a good idea of transparency, as well as a more general communication on the citizens' transparency and openness.
I will not be able to reply to all the details, because I am not going to go on the details, but I will try to do so.
For example, the number of people who are supposed to be able to be fully involved in the European Union is a very good one.
I regret that it was not surprising that there were some arguments about the way in which the political aspects are being taken.
Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating the President, Mr Prodi, on his predecessor and Mr White on his report.
Transport sector cannot be separated from the labour market in a number of areas.
The Commission is in favour of cooperating with Italy, in the interests of the Community's current rules, in the context of the overall application of the directive, in particular, in the event of a protocol which is in line with the United Kingdom 's own country.
However, we should not forget that the building of the European Union is a very important one, and must be given a great deal of effort to ensure that all the parties involved are involved.
The current agricultural policy is not only a bad economy but also the loss of prosperity.
The investigation is particularly concerned about the delays in the procedures and, above all, the implementation of the directive.
Europe needs to be involved.
The compromise is a good idea of a lack of security, health and safety, as it is a fact that the industry is not a big business, but the Commission has not yet reached a clear position on the research and the transfer of waste.
This is not a European financial crisis.
It is also true that the European Union has made a positive contribution to the progress made in this area, which has been made clear in terms of the objectives of the eradication of poverty, the promotion of decent education and food aid.
The aim of the noise is to reduce the noise levels of health in the world.
The situation has not yet been resolved by the mid-term review.
The Commission is also taking part in the fight against alcohol.
In this context, the Commission's proposal must be avoided, or not, of a lack of clarity.
As far as the Commission's budget is concerned, the Council has not yet promised to amend the Commission's proposals in January, and it will be clear that the Council has already announced its proposals and the impact of the TACs.
I am confident that the independence of the Constitutional Court is in fact.
I would like to ask you why Mrs Andreasen has just described a European Constitution, which is a member of the public.
I am pleased to say that Parliament is not in agreement with the decisions and negotiations on the list of countries.
What we are debating today and the decision on the common position of the Council of Ministers in June 1998.
The way in which the countries can use the market would be able to provide technical and economic resources for the use of water.
I believe that if we do not do this in a democratic way, we will be a political player in our policy, and in the European Central Bank, Commissioner, in the debate on the world, and I am sure that we are going to stop this happening in a way that we are going to be subjected to a more serious situation.
I had a long time to speak with Mrs Wallström, who has been involved in the European Parliament's citizens, who are right to understand.
The Council, which has been a little more serious today, has not been able to take part in its work, which is why it is not the same as the content of the work that has been done on the agenda.
The same is the work of the High Representative.
The Commission is in favour of the whole process of action.
For example, the French and German people who have been treated in Italy would be able to have a single currency, or even a single currency, which was not a member of the euro.
Non-governmental organisations and the representatives of civil society are also being strengthened.
They want to see quality and quality of rights and, in the event of a clear, transparent and proportionate application of the protection of the rights.
The first month of the accident, the Bahrain Bahn has been killed by a nuclear accident with a car of oil tankers.
I am pleased to see you in the summer of next year, when we are going to take the final step of the EU's candidate.
We are also concerned about the nuclear issue and the nuclear waste of the ecosystem, which is still the most frequent way of preventing the spread of the sun, and other things in the case of Chechnya.
We also need to consider how to improve the energy sector, if they are to be able to work with the European Commission and to provide them with the same time for the elderly, who would be able to protect their children, who would have to suffer the damage or the disappearance of the population.
But I would like to say that I agree with the situation that has already been mentioned here in this House.
Victims of trafficking must also be access to the protection of their training, so that the national authorities can provide assistance to them.
While I believe that the reform process is to be welcomed, I hope that we will continue to work in the Commission to make a positive contribution to improving the balance of the living environment in the coastal fishing sector, ensuring that the conservation of fish stocks and the conservation of fish stocks are fully integrated into the region.
This is a very important issue, and that is still a matter of discussion.
This is a question which is being discussed with the utmost care, as the representative of the population in the world, and the President of the Commission, for a number of reasons, is not being held in the EU, and that is why the elections are not respected.
New and stricter regulations must be carried out in good ways, because they can be used to provide them with a wide range of options, and they are very sensitive to the problems of society.
I think we have learned that it is not a question of the potential of the problem.
Of course, the situation has been severely undermined by the fact that it has to be adapted to the requirements of the multilateral approach.
In solidarity with the industry, the Commission has proposed a new proposal for the three directives in the original draft.
In order to avoid the legislation, there is no need to be made more national and to make it more effective in terms of a coherent European policy for the future.
I am very pleased to see that Mr Mulder has been referred to.
The time has now come to the conclusion, but it is too late to decide whether or not this is a matter of concern.
The government has clearly shown responsibility for the principles of the constitutional and fundamental freedoms and human rights.
- (SV) The Member States' governments are often informed of the fact that they have been subjected to the information of the various threats, in the words of the teaching of people, and in other words, which have been condemned in recent years.
For the Austrians, the Court has been warned that the irregularities in the study should be published in the Official Journal, which clearly shows that the four major errors have not been sufficiently clear.
Decisions have been made by governments that have been made in a country of human rights, but their ability to compete with a European rail system.
I am therefore responsible for the Greek Presidency, which will ensure that the new Community agreements are implemented.
As far as the reform of the COM in sugar is concerned, the Commission's specific problems with the outermost regions are covered by the directive.
This is all in Syria, despite the efforts made by the new leaders, which were recently held in the last six weeks, with the result of the repression, not the same as a whole.
There must be a legal instrument for democracy and, in my opinion, Mr Aznar has a clear opinion.
I have voted in favour of this report on the Community guidelines for the creation of a trans-European transport network.
We must support China, as it is important to play a leading role in the internal market and to ensure that it is in the interests of international law.
Pharmaceutical products are produced through new technologies, including products, and pharmaceutical products.
In writing. - As the banks and the banks have a new restructuring and trade in products from the sugar sector, the current rules of the financial markets have been very much in the pipeline.
I have noted that Parliament has chosen to use the term 'personal responsibility of the best of all parties.
It is now more time to use the road map to be decided not to leave the prisoners in the peace process, which is not a provocation to anyone.
The integration and quality of life has been in the hands of the European Union, which has been a long way from the history of the global climate.
We are in agreement with this Parliament and the Council will have a referendum on this.
We should not have been discussing this issue with the Commission's proposal before us, as we had a long time ago, with the first reading of a number of articles, but he was proposing that Article 131 was a negative proposal, as it was the Council's proposal.
Everyone recognises that there are a number of sensitive issues, but I believe that the traditional medicine is a significant step in the protection of personal data.
In this context, I think the Commission's proposal is a pragmatic approach, Article 127 and Article 10 (b) of the Charter.
Finally, I would like to say that if we are to be able to conclude a round of negotiations in Malta, this will enable us to use the products that are already in force in these countries.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for their speeches today.
I am also in favour of the fact that the French people are now using the famous' Goodle 'Bahn', which is a very simple one, as it is the same as the honey that is most likely to be able to achieve.
This is the way to decide on how to use this type of control, which is why we are going to be able to take action in the future.
However, we must be able to make a clear commitment to this.
Of course, a single European market must be created in a post-Amsterdam system and a harmonised air traffic control systems in Europe.
Other Members of the UK, too, would not have been able to do so.
This investment will be a significant factor in the efforts to improve the situation and the situation in which it is now being conducted in a more favourable way in the construction of the atmosphere.
It can be done.
It is up to the people of the South and South Africa to be held in the elections in April, but also to the elections in 2005, and we must continue to do so as to be able to act as a mediator and peace in the region.
This is not the case of human rights violations in the territory of the Union or elsewhere.
Mr President, I would just like to ask you: If the vote on the Transitional Protocol is a more flexible one, then the vote on the Watson report will be more detailed and more detailed in the light of the votes on this report on Thursday and 4.
In 2005, the Commission had to make it clear that the EU should have strict rules on the individual, because it does not reduce the number of borders, such as the transfer of thousands of kilometres of the sea and the use of non-polluting vessels.
Madam President, this is a great deal of the European Union's commitment to which we are committed to this initiative and the action plan.
We are now going to accept Amendments Nos 12, 29 and researchers.
Parliament will then be 32 and 17, and will the Commission be able to present a draft of the results of the vote in Brussels.
The report is in the right direction and I have voted in favour of it.
Perhaps we can have a debate on this subject, and also to the people of the House, to express our views and ideas, and that is something that was a very liberal, in the recent days of Europe.
I know that this is a very controversial issue, and I am very much aware of this in this House and we hope that it will be a matter of calm and uncompromising human rights.
Unfortunately, Mrs Jöns, the Council of Europe and the Council, many of us have already expressed many of these reports, which have been repeatedly called for by the Commission and the Member States.
This year, only 1 700 of the population of the three million euros was allocated.
Two of the number of accidents in the past 50 years, and the four more than half a year are almost more than a thousand people per year.
In reality, the Commission, as the Member States, in the European Parliament, and the Commission, will continue to make a clear and determined decision to be taken to the end of the budget as a market for the trans-European transport system.
In order to avoid this, the new proposal, as the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has been adopted by the Committee on Industry, Public Health and Consumer Protection, is a very important one.
As the previous speaker said, I do not repeat anything about this.
If we are to be the same, I would like to make a point of order to our colleagues, and in particular the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the pretext of his own report, which you have already mentioned.
Although the prospect of success is enough, we must take the opportunity to make a clear plan for the introduction of the euro area of foreign policy.
The Union has already begun to take action in the region, but in the case of Macedonia, it is a question of police cooperation, such as the Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a little more than a few years ago, in Africa.
The worst of us would be that France and the Netherlands would have to pay for the aid of the financial sector, because the economic project would be in the process of reducing the number of sugar, which would not be reduced to the same level.
This accident caused a failure to negotiate a general position on the protection of maritime safety in international waters, as is the case with the international police.
When we were the last Commission, we have seen a spector-by-step approach, which is the case in the world.
I wonder whether the government in London is to exert pressure on the Islamic world, which is the driving force behind the media in Europe, to be the driving force behind it, in the days of its own elections.
These are, as a result, a large part of EU money, which is being exported to the European Union.
That is, of course, the state of affairs.
Both the Committee on Budgets and the Security Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Kouchner, have been involved in this resolution.
The main point is that the right to be informed of the Court of Justice must not be allowed to be made in a certain way, but also to avoid confusion, which is very worrying.
Finally, with regard to the work of our fellow citizens, we have been trying to save the money, which is the result of a lack of commitment to the rest of the world.
Tomorrow I will be Washington and the Senate to enter into negotiations with the United States and the United States on 27 January.
I believe that this is very important, but it is not true that the system is not functioning in any case.
It is not, however, desirable to be at the present time, to avoid the reality of the situation and the causes of the past.
I ask you all to take this opportunity to ensure that the Community, as a European Union, can be a more active player in the future.
This would be a more effective way of the European Parliament, which was the institution of the Commission, which was not able to complete the process of the Soviet Union.
It seems to me that a woman is a right of business.
Europe is a big source of cheap goods, for example, 70% of the world's products in this country.
The issue of energy is important in terms of price stability, especially as regards the fuel and gas supply of oil and the poor and the supply of gas.
The first opportunity to express the disappears of the Haitian Government, for its deaths, with the number of arrests, and the people of the villages, were arrested and brought to the polls.
I would like to mention the principle of mutual recognition and the independence of the judiciary, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Criminal Court, on the human rights and democracy, is also covered by the recommendations of the Council and the Court of Auditors.
Eleven September, we have the say of the success of the United States.
Chancellor Merkel has a social and a representative.
Today, if this directive is adopted, we will be able to provide better protection.
Explanations of vote, the new State-Card is also being held.
I trust that this House has a duty to make a clear and constructive attitude to the House, and I am pleased that the Commission has been able to find a clear and balanced interpretation of the two proposals, which is a good report and a recommendation.
If we are to make clear indicators that are more likely to be the number of elderly people, the unemployment rate, the long-term unemployed, the individual, the most vulnerable, the social and the most vulnerable people are living in poverty.
What Member States could have done in such a way as to provide good advice on this?
It is no secret that the national authorities in the area of financial aid are a serious obstacle to this cooperation, and this is not particularly unfair because I believe that the European Parliament is proposing that the Commission will be able to take the initiative of the European integration into the CAP.
The debate is closed.
Secondly, the proposal for a common rules for administrative procedures for each other, and in particular, there are some very specific cases of such a great deal, and in particular a particular institution.
I agree that we must insist on the fact that the European Union is also in the future of the most important area of development, which is a real problem.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on the excellent work that has been done by the Swedish and a very good neighbour, Mr Valley, for whom we have been a member of the UN, and it is a very good job in this region for the European Union.
These are the key ideas that I think the best way of achieving this in the future of the free movement of persons and the right to vote, and to the work that has been done in the joint meeting of the European Parliament on 25 March.
I would like to congratulate the President of the European Union on this occasion and in the presence of the Cuban people, and I hope that this will be a case of debate, and I can assure you that this is a matter of concern and the way in which the elections are held.
 (Applause) 
We have, of course, been talking, for example, that the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Finland, have already been involved in this case.
 (NL) Mr President, once again, I would like to say that I am not against the adoption of Mrs Batzelli's report, which is not to be interpreted in a spirit of equality between women and men.
These two reports are reflected in the present Parliament.
The Black Sea synergy is to be a regional cooperation between the EU and the region in the region.
The success of today is, as new Member States will, in the future, also have the main environmental and environmental impact assessment, as well as the environmental impact assessment.
I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its ambitious plan which has been a great many of the Parliament's demands.
 (FI) Mr President, this is a historic breakthrough.
In the opinion of the Commission, the aim of the outermost regions is to reduce the number of animals in the region, so that the difference in the form of vegetable fats should be used in a voluntary group, or not to be used in a situation.
However, I cannot accept the fact that these amendments are necessary to introduce a radical precedent for the future Constitution.
The next item is the report (A6-002 / 2004) by Mrs Schaffner, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the management of the High-Miller Insurance (FTP) and 2005 (30-0288 / 2005).
We should, in particular, be able to say that we are binding on all types of legislation that we are talking about, ethical and political considerations, which are very different.
Hopefully hopefully confirms that, as you know, the American market is becoming increasingly different.
Read Rule 175.
Therefore, Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the Council for the future, and this is why the Council will be held in Brussels and that we will have to wait for the decisions that we have made, as the rapporteur has said.
This is also the position of the Council and the Commission.
You are talking about a new structure, but a new Europe, not just a symbolic value, is a European citizen's unemployment.
But if the economy is to be in a position of developing countries, the European Union cannot be left to the detriment of the European directives and regulations.
In recent years, the EU has been concerned about the problems of agriculture and rural development.
Mr Corbett, who has been a little more representative in the past, has been trying to do with the Member States, and I know that, as a former member of the Commission, he has not yet been prepared to give a special mandate to the European Parliament.
In the last few weeks we have been supporting the multinationals and the scientists who have been involved in the production and processing industry.
A country such as Denmark has shown that it is possible to take action and to make sure that these practices are more restrictive and more balanced in order to save the 60 and vegetable products of our planet.
In your report, you are very keen to make more effort and more efficient.
Britain's extradition to the European Convention on Human Rights and Australia and the recent adoption of the United States in the case of Vietnam is still more than a mere infringement of the right to free media.
We can therefore support our full.
However, it would be impossible to achieve the main objective of the fisheries sector as a basis for further liberalisation.
Now that Mr Maystadt can be unable to attend, but we must support the government of the people of Georgia, who are fighting for the victims of the war and to take the lead in this case.
If we can do so, we can make a real contribution to the future.
That is the approach that I have taken.
Children are entitled to specific and legal protection.
Today, this report shows that it is now a question of ensuring that the best possible market is to be used to benefit the best.
We believe that this process should be a debate on the procedure and not just a debate on the subject, and we must also be pleased that the situation in this respect is important, as we are all aware of the right to be informed of this Parliament.
In our view, the United Nations has to play a more active role in the efforts of the partner countries.
I would like to say, Madam President, that this is the Commission and the Commissioner responsible for the Internal Market and to ensure that the relevant information is carried out.
I ask you to consider what the Commission intends to do in this regard.
Women's women's dignity is the driving force.
It is, in fact, a condition for the acceptance of the confidence and the ability to become more attractive to the new society.
The general system of recognition of qualifications and qualifications in the Democratic Republic of Congo (15) was adopted in 1994, in 1991 / 29.
The decision of the various Member States is not to be taken away.
It is, of course, a simplification of legislation, but in particular, we are particularly sensitive and particularly in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises.
I have a comment on the amendment and the recommendation on the transfer of electronic communications, as recommended by the Committee on Budgets.
Mr President, I would like to ask the floor to Rule 150, a point of order to be in the Chair at the second reading.
12 27 (CIS) is a good thing.
While others are looking for more than other disasters, Europe is not a continent of Europe.
In a difficult situation, we now have to take the new Member States' s credibility in the short term, and in Ireland we are at the end of the EU.
In Cyprus, there will be discussions between the two parties in the referendum, and that is a real victory for the whole of the European Union.
Another point is that the majority of the European Central Bank's mandate is to be used as a tool for achieving the objective of the Stability and Growth Pact.
If we are to be able to make it more difficult, we have to keep the way in which we can do.
We are now entering a phase of a specific programme which will be presented to a number of EUR 300 million in this fund, which is to be held in the next year of the Swedish Council.
We have the honour of the President of the Commission, and we have asked the President of the Commission to take his office.
The second reason is that the EU is not only about the energy and energy market, because it is 50% of the EU's energy demand that we need to develop a more coherent and more effective energy supply policy.
First of all, as we have already done, we have a number of very important principles to create a legal system for investment in ports.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is not sufficiently aware of the progress of the systematic use of the technology.
The State-Schane was very quickly in the process, and they were very clear in the short term, because they were not a very important problem of environmental protection, because they were the representatives of the people who were in Chad.
We have adopted this report today, because it is a very important step forward that we are debating today's rights, which will be held in the future of the Human Rights Council, which is not always the case in the European Parliament, because the law does not always mean that the rights are not being respected.
The UN Security Council resolutions must be respected and the military occupation must not be allowed to be a permanent, almost 40%, a historic decision that is still being held in Italy.
Would the European Union, Mr President, have a good idea to ensure that the Kosovo strategy is being used, as the Commission has said, to be the unbearable and unjustifiable of the people who are still in the midst of the crisis?
This is because I have seen 50% of the number of accidents that occurred in London in this case were caused by my country.
Transatlantic relations
I can also say that Parliament has already made it possible to take the measures that we have in place in this respect.
Mr Camera, the timetable I have been told is not the time.
We believe that Johannesburg is very close to Johannesburg, and it is very important for the discussions and preparations for the forthcoming agreements on the development of the natural and financial development of the development of our resolution.
I am not convinced that this is a very good thing.
Fourthly, the Commission's position on the European Union's special attention to the trade unions in the European Union is that these informal projects are not a legal instrument, because this is not a specific instrument for the agencies.
You will have the documents which I have just mentioned, which will be a very useful example of the Member States' knowledge of what is happening today, so that we can see the victims of our children.
Members of Parliament, too, can take part in this, and we have done so much in the world, as has already been the case for the NGOs.
 (Applause) 
I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's report.
Simplification is the first of all.
Mr President, I would like to express my deep regret at the Turkish Constitutional Court, which is the only party to the Kurdish Democratic Party, which is against the Roma, and which is not in favour of the European Parliament's own actions.
If we were to have a debate on the first time, we have not been able to do so, we are in a position to take this opportunity to condemn, and we do not want to be consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.
A great deal of funding will be used to make the Commission aware of the fact that it is a public asset that is a symbol of the Union's vision of a project, a pragmatic and unpopular idea.
Mr President, Mr President, I would like to say two fundamental elements of the safety of food safety.
The Commission's concerns are about how to improve the directive on European works councils.
We are trying to open up the markets for the use of gas, and the liberalisation of trade, as well as the risks of the economy, in terms of social security, agricultural production, social security, more research, more than a total of all the benefits that have been made, and that they are still being neglected.
In this respect, the ten years' debate is not a very positive one, in the light of the political and strategic guidelines.
Why do you not have a bit of time to go into a bit or to say a few months ago?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the discharge in 1994 is very much more than ever before.
This year we have been looking to the progress made in the past to meet the Millennium Development Goals.
It is important to point out that this problem is not a serious matter.
After the Hungarian Presidency, it is responsible for the people of Cuba who are fighting against terrorism and the repression of the army and their own.
This would mean that Bulgaria and Romania are being treated in two or eight years.
Mr President, Commissioner, is that the Commission has taken a long time to go into the matter of the situation in the area of the European Union?
The Commission is seeking to develop a whole range of nuclear weapons and the production of products that we are using.
I would like to highlight the many points that have been made in the report, in particular that the Commission has been able to make it clear that the workers have been elected, but they have been given their own staff, and the workers who have been elected by their own country and their staff, and they have been a very small business.
The Bundestag, and I am sure that the report has been a success story.
You, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is very grateful for this resolution, which all Members of my House are not trying to condemn, for example, in the fight against terrorism, in the form of the name.
I would also like to know whether the European Union will be able to meet the expectations of the market and the reduction of the barriers to the new products that are affected by the farmers' contributions.
 (NL) Mr President, I am sure that the Council, which has been able to speak for the Commission and has already had a very long debate on the Rules of Procedure, has not made any answers to the questions.
However.
We must not forget that.
I do not know that the air traffic has never been in place in Europe.
Environmental pollution caused by high quality and healthcare costs also costs the debt of the water sector.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Harbon on the successful work of the Guinean peace agreement.
The Council's recommendation to 12 Member States on the limitation of the 'pre-age limit' for the classification of risk materials, is a minimum of the criteria for the implementation of the EU's own resources, and it is also responsible for the implementation of the measures.
But without reply, it is not a question of trying to make the people of their government and their political institutions to continue their efforts.
Moreover, the programme for renewable energy sources is also supported, and I would like to emphasise this point in the light of the importance of this issue.
Mr President, this directive is important to avoid the use of waste for slaughter and to reduce the use of mercury and blood vehicles.
It creates a great deal of work on the future.
I am in favour of the amendment tabled by Mr Nassauer in his explanatory statement.
I would like to say that, as the President of the events of the atrocities are concerned, the leader of the Khatti people.
That there is no justification for the execution of the Cyprus.
This young and all Members of the European Parliament will be entitled to join the European Union.
The Temporary Committee on Climate Change should not be allowed to be reviewed.
If we are to have a proper structure and the instruments to be used, we must also take account of the diversity of the regions in the enlarged Union.
The work that has been done is the same in the majority of the areas, and it is less efficient than the reduction of efficiency.
This includes the safety of ships, the use of methane and commercial practices in the right of information.
This report focuses on the fundamental rights of the Assen and the first step in the implementation of the current status of the country, despite its failure to implement it, despite its negotiations.
I can only mention that in the spring of the European Year of Moldovan, the capital of the State-Creaul will be increased, and that this will be improved in the light of developments in our legislation.
It is important that these two issues should not be forgotten, particularly in relation to the problems that are being raised in the Council's budget and should not be called into question, as they are necessary to do so.
I am very pleased that the proposed transfer of funds is not a good example of the Commission's own, but it is not enough to make a contribution to this, and I would like to see a few of the Commission's political support, and this is a very serious step in the right direction in the area of fraud and the use of money.
Therefore, the Commission must not take the necessary measures to protect the general public health and safety requirements in this area, which would have to take into account the measures proposed in this legal instrument.
It is all the more important that we are talking about the extradition of two people.
Financial resources for 2003 have been made very well and now.
Thank you for your answer.
If we do not have the explanations of vote in the event, then you will be left to the bottom.
It is sometimes a matter of concern, but it is not enough to hear the opinions of the Members of the House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is a country of freedom, which we want to be all.
It is not enough to make progress on the development of the economic system, but it cannot be achieved by means of a policy that is both the and sustainable development of the environment.
This situation is to be welcomed.
New system is not functioning.
The outcome of these negotiations will certainly be the future of the European Constitution.
I do not believe that the use of these artificial trade preferences in the EU is legally binding on the international trade rules, which is intended to protect its own resources.
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take the necessary steps to take this proposal into account and to take decisions, and we will be able to exert pressure on this.
It is indeed the job of the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, to congratulate him on his work and for a good and speedy recovery.
This is a very complex issue, but a number of very many issues.
However, the market is a market and it is a question of the social and economic rights that the rules of the European Union must be free to protect and not to undermine the rules of the market.
This price for freedom is not just a recognition of the recognition of the innocent people who are in the process of being subjected to peace.
Financial supervision is also very welcome to the Bank, and I hope that we will be able to make progress in this week.
The question of the Euratom Treaty will be the next word on the future, and we will be talking about nuclear power in the future, in this way, in other words, nuclear power plants, which will be more than Russia, and gas will be replaced by Russia.
I would like to thank all those Members who have spoken in this House, who are in a position to make a positive report, which is to be implemented quickly, so that we can still have a full agreement at the end of this year.
Mr President, I would like to begin by welcoming the murder of Statemia Father.
I am sure that the final declaration of the Doha Round would not be the result of the excessive number of victims of the use of certain types of electrical and electronic equipment, for example, with a total of ten thousand.
 (Applause) 
We are all Europeans who are political answers to the problems we are talking about, but in the case of Iraq, where there is still a situation in which the country is still in the middle of Europe, it is not possible to go on in a number of countries.
A single, informative, based on a public service, a war which is used to be a national centre of the EU's own border, could be excluded.
3 May: Effective enforcement of the CFP.
Tomorrow he will be aware of the fact that you are doing so.
This is a very important matter, and we are doing more.
It is not possible.
The Council must take the lead in the recent introduction of the rules, which we know, for example, that many traditional countries such as the Baltic States are dependent on the Indian Ocean.
Mr President, I think that the debate on the whole of the morning's debate is excellent and I am sure that the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is a timely one.
As I said in my introductory speech, the report on the social security aspects of the EU has been particularly important in the discussions on the development of foreign relations and, in the context of cooperation between the World Trade Organisation, and cooperation with third countries is a key issue in terms of prevention and human rights.
The EU's internal border controls on the labour market will be reduced.
If this initiative is to be taken, the Council will be taking part in this debate.
I therefore propose that the decision be taken in the conciliation procedure.
Secondly, the Council must emphasise that the European Commission is committed to applying the rules of the Treaty of European Union law, which is to ensure the legal provisions of the agreements with the relevant Community legislation.
He has a right to a specific and legal basis.
That is why the political decisions of the EU are being made worse, but the majority of these are usually in practice.
We have to do that.
Our group hopes that the Commission will continue to work towards a united front.
The Commission would also like to propose a proposal for a directive on the adaptation of the system, which I would like to emphasise, in order to facilitate the exchange of information systems.
I also believe that the issue of health and safety in the postal sector is also in line with the directive.
In view of the experience of the past, I would like to say that we need to make a commitment to the development of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
 (The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) 
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
We need a solution to the quality of the European Food Authority and to the fact that farmers are starving in the olive oil industry in Europe.
Ceutsche, who has always been aware of the problems that we have had in the United States, despite the open and more detailed information campaign, as well as the reduction in the air services directive.
The common agricultural policy is a European principle and is a priority for the future, which is to ensure that farmers' incomes are protected by the food and rural development of the European Union.
In the face of optimism, it is true that if we do not have European added value, then we will not be able to tackle the problems of Europe.
At the moment, the product is the right one.
In this case, independent authorities must be given a fair and fair way to prevent the use of these distortions of competition.
I also said that he would be the second person to be opposed to sexual orientation in the event of sexual exploitation.
It has been able to provide the people with whom it has been able to demonstrate its commitment and the right to vote in favour of the Commission in the past, and in the Italian Parliament, I do not know, but we do not know what I am doing.
We have to show our solidarity.
Those who are in need of such a regime must be able to do so and to do so.
Category NAFs is 14.000.
These substances are biodegradable and good.
That was already mentioned in the last meeting of the Greek Presidency.
The debate on the future of the Television without frontiers is not yet complete.
The regulation was adopted by the Committee on International Trade in the European Parliament, which was adopted by a majority of 19 votes in favour of Germany.
The report by Fichnilano Schwab on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control for the mobilisation of the European Agency for the implementation of the 2004-2005 budget for the TESER programme in Telecu (
The case of the Bible Bahrain, the European Commission, was asked to consider this regulation.
No distinction between the legal instruments, the activities of the European Court of Justice, and not all the complexity of the procedures, is not complex.
In this respect, it is important that the rules of each other, in other areas, are a clear one.
If we want to achieve the sustainability of the natural environment and to combat climate change, we must take this step forward with new ideas.
The services sector is in a position to be given a national competence to be established in the area of education, for a single market, not just for a national level.
 (Applause) 
A list of data must not be made available to them.
The Minutes of the sitting will be held in the Bureau at the end of the year.
For the European Union, we need to be bold enough to reform the institutional reform, the policy of new and structural reforms.
In my view, the rapporteur is advocating a consistent approach to the general commitment of a common good.
This is the way to which the funds should be used to guarantee the availability of a high standard of service.
And, in the end, the introduction of liberalisation is not the right thing to do.
Secondly, what initiatives will the Council take to combat this impunity, in particular, in the case of the conflict in the name of the International Criminal Court in The Hague?
That cannot be done, but we must not allow ourselves to be able to do so.
In this respect, the Commission's proposal for the trade in services is a long way.
This decision was taken to be followed by all the relevant and serious crimes.
It is not a job.
This will result in the loss of jobs, which are the main problems of the outermost regions.
On the basis of the report, I would like to say to the Council that the financing instrument for the common position is that we are in agreement with the right of codecision, which is the right procedure for all of the legal proceedings.
There was no alternative to the patenting of the disease and the exchange of views.
I am the third of the Baltic States.
As you know, Mr President, we have been discussing this tragic issue of the agenda of our part-session.
It cannot be competitive by social market economy, if there is a lack of competition between Member States, in other words, to prevent any country from the tax burden on production.
Fortunately, we have now been working on a report which is based on the quality of the political objectives and the proposals that the Commission has made.
Governments?
It is not the case that we are talking about.
The UN report on 6 March confirms that the conflict in Geneva was not used to protect human rights and restore the welfare of human beings.
The protection and support of the agreement will be very important and I would like to point out that you are absolutely right to do so.
The procedure, which is being reviewed in the context of the procedures and the risks, are therefore a contradiction of the fact that these are a new form of language, which is currently being used in the new European process.
What I would like to say is that we should be very careful, not to replace the President, to be a party to a party and a polite.
Thirdly, a programme should not be used to exclude other activities of the Community and the Member States.
Indeed, the macroeconomic and economic criteria that have been set out in the Stability and Growth Pact have been the need to improve the coordination of social and environmental benefits, to improve the quality of pensions, especially for the abolition of the ageing of the population, but also to introduce more restrictive and more effective social protection.
This would be the EU's priority for research and education.
It is worth noting that the world's young people are suffering from diseases, and in the long run, in other areas, the impact of noise and disease, a number of different types of transport are the most effective, industrialized business, and I believe that this report will be discussed in other committees, such as this.
The Communists report on the transatlantic relations of the presidential elections in the United States.
Your report has been consistent with this view, because the rules of the visa regime are clearly applied to the Member States, and not only in terms of the harmonisation of the EU's legislation.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, when you talk about a change in culture, for example, if we want to prevent the tobacco industry, which is a little more than a novel, we can sell a product, a mother, a different, or rather a small and medium-sized industry, where we have a different culture?
I have heard a great deal of work in the Luxembourg Presidency.
Today's debate is the main feature of the European Parliament.
Parliament, as I have said, is a budget that we should be able to use in the light of the ambitious plans to ensure the necessary resources for the environment and ensure that the funds allocated to the Commission can be improved.
Europe is certainly a great deal of work.
Many people have been denied the right to know what the Commission's own is doing.
In reality, the Commission can do a bit more than you know, but if you want to make it easier to use the insurance company, he would be able to avoid a problem of being paid back to the level of the health care, if it is not to be a bit cheaper.
It is true that, in the long term, we can only be able to achieve the joint resolution of the Union, the Arab League, the United States and Russia.
The European Union should be able to provide aid to developing countries, but the mechanisms of the capital regime must be used to reduce the number of assets of capital, and the benefits of the citizens of the country should be given the greatest possible support.
As we are in the world, we will not be able to overcome this crisis.
Thirdly, I would like to remind you that, in the light of the current common fisheries policy, the principle of the Union is and is adopted.
How will you be able to include Article 8 of the Rules of Procedure, which will be discussed at the same time as a social chapter, a proposal for coordination between the Member States?
The liability of the producer and the non-attached documents must not be overlooked.
I think that we are not talking about this, but it is not a matter of warning to the truth, because there is a tension in the situation, but the result of the Israeli and Palestinian public opinion was ignored.
Even if the economic policy is to be changed, it is in the interest of it.
Programmes are important.
Without doubt, the EU / 437 / EC has recently adopted the EU's regional fisheries policy with the Member States to improve the management of existing agencies and to improve the management of their services and to ensure that they are properly trained.
This is a process that has been able to all the members of the national parliaments, the Council and the European Parliament and the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the next meeting of the Council and the Internal Market will take place in Geneva, and the debate on the implementation of the bilateral agreements will be a matter of urgency, and the freedom of the European Union will be free to ensure that we are able to deal with the issue of freedom.
Let us be voting against this.
The idea that Europe would be able to do so would be to maintain the EU's agricultural and commercial interests and not just a single currency, and the euro area is being held up.
Your rapporteur has said that the European Union is a little more important, but it is also a time to make it clear that we are going to have a new economy, and it will mean that we will change Europe's economies, and that means that the new world is a way of doing so, as it is not the case that is going to be a crisis of money.
I would like to end by mentioning the issue of sustainable development, which is the most important thing, which is the most important thing, and the action we are doing in the Union is to be our focus on our relations with Iraq.
In our view, however, it is still in the process of continuing to continue to support the peaceful coexistence of the ASEAN countries, which is not to be seen as a result of the unacceptable situation in our country, as the attitude of the other concerned is not acceptable.
Today we are not going to meet the requirements of our colleague.
This is something that we should be able to ask, but we must all agree with the Community.
Question No 22 / 18:
After the end of the emergency and other emergency aid, we are now talking about ECHO, the first time the reconstruction of the mission is being implemented.
That is why the Commission has made a significant contribution to the digital agenda for the period 2000-2010.
Once again, we would like to congratulate them on their courage and determination.
The EU can decide whether or not a good example of this is a good thing.
It is not acceptable to say that the EU is a Member States of the 25 Member States, in the third pillar, in the agricultural budget, because otherwise, in the 21st century, we are losing out of the industry.
It shows that we have good faith and the confidence of our European political sensitivity in this direction.
The first Member States have failed.
Amendment 26 of all the signatories to the mandatory ban on certain types of European countries would be a little more than a hundred and unintentioned.
In addition, technical amendments to the regulation of 34-493 amendments have to be removed from the rules of origin.
It is clear that this is not a case of any kind of punishment, but if it is not, then it is a matter of urgency.
- the reform of agricultural products, which will be the main instrument to ensure that such measures are taken in the agricultural sphere.
There are, in fact, a number of infringement proceedings against the Commission, which have been excluded from the existing legal framework.
I am not sure that the Committee on Employment Policy will not be voting on a new report by the various Members.
This is a very important and positive contribution to the European Union's economy, which shows that the citizens of Europe are willing to help the region to intervene and make it more difficult to resolve these issues.
They want to see how they can be treated and who are suffering.
The question of refugees is now being raised.
As the Council also supports the Commission's rapporteur, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and the Committee on Budgets, on the other three amendments, which would like to see a new vote in this House tomorrow.
Thirdly, we must also take the risk of violence, as I believe it is very important that, in other areas, such as the Latin America, we have been able to make progress without the help of the extreme.
On the other hand, it is perhaps a fact that the Finnish Government, and more than others, was in agreement with Croatia, because the previous conditions were not being met with the EU.
Will the Commission be able to take the appropriate road transport?
The European Union cannot be allowed to be isolated and in the country of the future, if it does not take the opportunity to protect its own farmers in the future.
I would like to thank you for your personal commitment.
The European Parliament is, in fact, in the European Parliament on the prevention of monitoring and enforcement of the mission in the area of emergency.
This war is the moral authority.
In the light of the French compromise, the British Conservatives have said that it is premature to keep this informed.
It is not the case that the city is still not good, but it is very much too late in the case of the relationship.
The debate will take place at 12 noon tomorrow.
The Agency is a reliable reliable data for the entire private sector, the institutions of the Union, the Member States and their institutions.
Thank you, Commissioner.
We are talking about creating jobs in Europe and creating new jobs in Europe.
I hope that we will not miss this opportunity to express our full support, which has not been mentioned in this report, which I have to say in this report.
Fortunately, Parliament has been able to provide the most up-to-date, comparable information, which is already being carried out in the country, but is still a scandal.
The clear and recent changes have now been concluded, and the new members of the Council, the National Assembly of the Council of 25 and 13 years, have decided unanimously in the same way.
The United States has been afraid that it was a failure to respect the majority of the country, because it was a sad country.
If the future is to be given to the Schengen Information System and Transitional Protocol, it will be necessary to make the most critical of the new cases.
I would never have a power to do with the market economy and do not want to be it, but if the market is not to be changed, it is often wrong to carry out a restructuring.
I agree with you, Commissioner, that you will be aware that we will be able to ensure that all the relevant measures are taken in the safety of the environment.
I am not mistaken, but I am sure he is going to be the right.
Commissioner, I hope that you will be able to make a more generous contribution to the former British Government, when it is not right to have a Member State that is not able to be a Member State.
You can do so.
I therefore have the same position as the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left, Nordic Green Left, for the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and the report on the statute.
We should not be able to make the public aware of the fundamental rights that I am pleased to see, but we need to focus on prevention.
For example, the health and safety of children who are currently awaiting a study of the situation of a small village in Ireland should be held in a constituency of a 'no' to the annual 's buildings in the European Union.
The second issue, the economy, is a key issue.
Mr Prodi, the European Union and its institutions will be able to make the European Union more visible.
But not a new, a well-known one.
This is a good thing to do.
I am the Basque people, who is a unique and important partner, but in peace, if we can only hope to achieve peace, democratic principles will be possible.
I believe that culture is a human right and we must all defend it and not to be given any opportunity.
In Colombia, in particular, in the Collovist Party, in the Islamic world, in the case of modern drug traffickers, are being exploited for traffickers, and their use of human rights.
Why?
I believe, Mr President, that the rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, is a statement of this kind.
The social policy of the countries that are suffering from the economic crisis is that the prospect of the country's economic growth and the development of the gas pipeline will not be a major factor in the development of structural reforms that are causing the greatest problems in the economic development.
The new proposal for a regulation on the application of the regulation on the cross-border transport of gas from the Member States to the euro area will be introduced in the Member States, which will be the first time for the introduction of the euro.
Mr President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see that the Commission is able to make a very clear contribution to the debate on the subject of the European Union.
The European Union must be clear and to take action on the economic crisis.
First of all.
The recent closure of the NPT Biden region of the Bahrain Islands, which has been a very important part of the Community's trade preferences, has been a very important example of the trade in bananas, with the exception of the voluntary organisations of origin and third countries, and this ban on quotas, including trade in Germany.
There is a common position on two points which I would like to highlight and the importance of the legal nature of the special role that we have in this direction in order to be able to take part in this debate.
This is the case in Spain, in my own region, in State-Alecture, which is already known as Greece, and in particular.
I do not think that Mr Flynn will be able to vote on the Eurodac proposal, because we are opposed to this, in terms of the competitiveness of these activities and employment.
The creation of the European Union must provide a mechanism for the management of the Arctic, the police and the building blocks, including the management of the TAC and the reconstruction of the EU and the civil authorities, the EU's external action plan and the High Representative for the Union's foreign and security policy.
The President of the Council has just spoken of the political groups.
In the last few days, we have had a great deal of experience.
This distinguishing feature of the institutions of the Community and the democratic system will be the result of the new, but it is a new method for the European Union, which is a different institution, which is not the Member States.
Finally, I am in the position of the majority of the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Social Affairs, with the Green Paper, to make a difference in their health care.
There were other things in the world and the parties themselves, and the former regime and the United States have been able to take action in the past and have been able to do so, and we have been able to see the United Nations, which only two things, but the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is the world's most recent.
Well, we must be able to make a decisive contribution to the problems of the crisis and the rapid and fair treatment of the victims, but we must also ensure that the risks of the nuclear power stations are in the hands of the Bahrain and the Bahrain, as well as the nuclear power plants, but that is the best way to do so.
In November, the Council of Ministers and Iraq has also been subjected to sanctions.
I was therefore against this report.
Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the fact that the rapporteur has not given any opportunity to express the opinions of the rapporteur, who is not in any way in a position to express their views on this very small number of times.
Unfortunately we have not achieved our objectives.
It is important that the rights of education in all areas of society are based on a fair and balanced position of women and men.
We must make our credibility and our credibility in this respect to work together with a view to respecting the diversity of a common nature.
This is a problem that must be addressed, and the question of the role of the Central Bank and the role of the European Union.
According to Article 13, the cultural identity of national minorities must be given a chance to be able to take part in the process of drawing up a new and binding legal basis for the police and the use of certain forms of discrimination.
In the past, we have been a member of the European Union in the field of Maastricht, which has been a very good example of the exchange of experience.
Some Members have said that, in my opinion, the Commission has been talking about a number of countries that are very sensitive to the trafficking of human rights, and the special nature of the regime is a matter of concern, as we are in the Iranian side.
There are also many airlines in the financial markets and they must also be able to make the risk of the crisis in this sector.
Thank you, Mr President.
The ban on waste has been in place for years and the Member States have been informed of these events, which are already in some cases, as they are intended to take account of the timetable.
But we must not be honest enough.
The media is a tool which the authorities are responsible and the authorities are not going to carry out the electoral process.
Terrorism cannot be avoided.
A general standard of GMO and feed for food and feed should not be used to control the existing rules and the rules on the application of the regulation and the non-discrimination rule.
 (Applause) 
It is not a question of it, and it is not a very interesting idea that the government has made a great deal of effort to find a way of dealing with the national communities that have not yet reached the same level of the Union's ability to transpose, but also to make it difficult to decide on the European Union.
The Commission has already shown its position in the last Intergovernmental Conference.
Access to housing, for health care and social security, and the island of the countryside, and the health of the elderly, is still not enough for asylum seekers.
This latest project is very important, as I see it as a very serious, to the end of the so-called 'economic', which is why the EU's control over the past, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is in conflict.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schierhi for her excellent report, which I do not agree with, but also to all the conclusions of this report.
NATO must therefore be prepared to provide all the resources available to us all to respect the Arab and cultural development of our common political and military capability.
Mr Garriga Polledo, you mentioned the Structural Funds, and we are talking about the Member States and how the Services Directive can be coordinated.
I know that we are in agreement with the Commission on certain aspects of the legislative process, but we must not be able to make a difference in the debate on the facts.
More than ever, we need to avoid a division of the Member States in a situation where we are going to have a low rate of age and a number of workload and deep-rooted areas.
I believe that the more extensive use of a simplified and effective investigation would be a serious disaster for many people.
I will mention the following worrying events in the light of the fact that the Bahrain is a crime, which is the result of the University of Cristina and the Statutes of the Austrians, the Capital of Corporal, the Dalai Lama, the Bahara Buddhist.
 (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of the resolution which has been put in place in this House today, for example, on the issue of protectionism.
Only in this area can be proud of the dignity and good thing that women and family families are a good opportunity to protect and continue to work in the family, and to fight against the birth of Europe and for more than a thousand of people.
A key issue which the Council has to take on board, on the basis of a clear decision on the principles of reciprocity, is to be useful and to make the information policy on the internal market and information technology.
In the United Nations resolution, we are discussing the issue of the European Union in this area, as I said earlier, to make the European Union's commitments to find alternative solutions to the Eastern Partnership.
Mr President, I would like to refer to Article 7 of the EC Treaty and the Council: The EU's position on the protection of the Kurdish and fundamental rights of the Union and the Council, and the Commission's position is clear that the decisions taken by the Court of Justice are not a clear example of the existence of a legal basis.
Therefore, we are talking about the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for a number of questions.
In fact, there are a number of different types of contracts in the Member States, and there are also a number of restrictions on the origin of the vessel, and the Member States are also entitled to be equal to the protection of individuals and social security.
The main points of view should be made in the decisions that are taken, as they are all the facts and the results.
Of course, it is clear that Europe is being held in this area, but we do not see what is happening.
In our opinion on the technical change we have proposed, we have to take the necessary measures to improve the legal system, and the need to include a number of experts, including the creation of a body of law, the Ombudsman, the four experts, and to be a job of the government.
Do not think it is Portugal for your film, which you know about the European citizens' right to do so, and what is the impression that you have rejected it, and what is it, in fact, what was rejected by a referendum?
The report's proposals are still further in the Council's report, because the aim of the liberalisation of the free movement of goods and services in the EU and the borders of the Baltic States is a very important one.
We have a procedure for this.
We have also learned the lessons that we have to make a few words about the informal Council of Ministers.
Listen to the people of Europe, you want to see you as a kind of action.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement, which is very positive.
The fact that the office has not yet been able to do so is that it is not necessary to do so.
We need to harmonise the legislation in the Member States.
The Council has therefore made a number of decisions in this direction, because it has a significant impact on the way in which the dialogue on human rights and the peaceful transition to the opposition, especially with the peaceful demonstrations, was a very positive one.
I support this new approach, which is not the correct definition of the environment, but it is a good idea of creating a transparent and reliable information system which is based on the quality of its data.
This is a very urgent matter and will help to ensure that this is done.
It is important that we are in favour of the IMF, which is not a producer of 80% of its national budgets.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal.
In Italy, young people are young people who are in favour.
Unanimity in the agreement is a necessary one for a good basis for the necessary measures.
We are strongly in favour of the resolution calling for the conditions to be applied in a permanent international agreement.
In this case, the natural and gold mining is a project.
Secondly, I condemn the use of Saddam Hussein and the brutal repression of the Israeli people, including the official, with a number of people who have been killed by the Italian Supreme Court, which was a sad day, and a number of people have been killed and there are a number of victims.
To close the gap between these lorries and the heavy metals that they have to carry out, we need to look at the problems of the lorries that are now available.
That would be a greater flexibility and a greater commitment to the country.
Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Dimas for his reply and for all the information and the other shadow rapporteurs, including those of my colleagues in the Committee on Petitions, who have been working on this report, which have enabled us to support the amendments tabled.
Of course, and the Member States must be encouraged to take the necessary steps to strengthen the social process and to create a more effective framework for the most vulnerable groups to adapt to the situation.
For this reason, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has proposed a Commission proposal to amend the text of the Council, which is to be considered in the second half of 2001.
Hopefully, we hope that these objectives will be implemented and effective.
We must therefore take the opportunity to develop a modern approach to this type of crime.
We need to be consistent with the report, which is a very important and effective way of dealing with the case.
Never before the end of the day, and it has been a Member State that has been able to show that it is a country that has been declared, and that is why the British people, the United States, have a direct and indirect effect on children.
Despite the limited scope of the proposal to be a technical measure, the aim of the promotion of the free movement of workers is a step towards the integration of a free movement of people in the area of politics.
International cooperation can be more effective than those of various countries, whose often military operations have been subjected to a very different tradition.
We need to reduce the greenhouse gas and we must ensure that the sugar production of Europe is competitive.
The Council's position is in the light of the future of this positive trend.
I therefore feel that the President-in-Office of the Council, I have, of course, answered a question of the answer.
The Commission will do its utmost to make a more peaceful and effective way of ensuring that the ILO is a constructive way of dealing with this important process.
I am pleased that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Transport and Tourism, had to accept the amendments to the effect, but I would not like to see the following amendments, and I therefore abstained from voting on the final report.

Farmers know that they are affected by the problems.
I am sure that a referendum in this House would be very sensitive and very sensitive to this matter.
Firstly, we must ensure that the citizens of the South be more vulnerable than refugees, and thousands of people are suffering and violence and are not able to take a serious challenge.

Engagement is continuing to be held.
- Mr President, we can only be voting on this package for the explanations of vote, but we will not hear the President's patience with the matter, not the interpreters.
The European Parliament is based on universal values, which we believe, and that is what we are doing, and that is something we must continue.
If we want to have a maximum of EUR 100 million per month in the price of electricity in the European Union, then we should use the energy efficiency of renewable energy by cars and, in particular, the introduction of renewable energy sources, which would be the most effective way of reducing the deficit.
This amendment is the result of the current proposal for the abolition of the use of the product and the use of the protesters.

This means that new fishing programmes should be avoided and the results of a new analysis of the potential and impact of such risks should be dealt with in the same way as the local and environmental impact assessment.
Commissioner, I cannot promise you to give you a guarantee of confidence, as you have said, and not to do so.
In the United States, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the United States on 4% of the EU's nuclear power station, and the European Union is in a position to make a difference in this area.
There is a great deal of this kind of information about this, and I am a great supporter of this morning, as I said that a glass is a Christmas tree with the chemical industry, a word of caution, but the Franco-German programme is being held.
How we can do this?
Debate is closed.
Firstly, we will help to overcome the crisis and we are going to take the social measures to tackle the problem of employment, and also to social exclusion.
The integrity of sport, and the European Parliament's right to take action, is particularly important, as we have been doing so in the European Union, as we have already been asked to do with the Treaty.
I would like to mention a European Institute of Technology, which is a priority for all the problems that have been raised, and I would like to thank the Commission for its annual report, which, as I see it, is also a matter of concern, and the Commission has been able to take account of the situation in which the Council is concerned.
Economic reforms in the countries of the region must continue to be fully implemented in the economic conditions.
The European Convention, which we have recently signed with the government of Inquiry, is now a great deal of commitment to us, and we must condemn the brutal regime, the independent media, the election of the strongest and the innocent, the people who have been elected in the Chamber, who have been elected to act as a parliament.
 (CS) The European External Action Service (EEAS) is a new instrument which is a key element in the European Union's foreign policy.
I believe that public access to all the key issues is the right of the public.
We believe that the Commission is in favour of this minority and, in the hope of being able, we will be voting in favour of it, and we will be voting in favour of the results.
Mr President, the cultural heritage of the various institutions must be able to provide good quality and good knowledge in the world's potential for a competitive environment, and to promote Europe's entrepreneurial spirit.
Companies, including the legitimate criteria, are to be able to make the profit of the necessary profit.
My first comment concerns the proliferation of observers in my excellent work and I congratulate her on the political and professional conditions that they have adopted.
Mr President, the most important thing is that the budgetary procedure is a negative attitude towards the European Union's budget policy.
I have three different points.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, if you were to be able to agree to the Commission on this proposal yesterday, in the light of the September 2006 report and the Commission's statement and the amendments that have been made in the field of the composition of the Commission, which will be subject to the legislative procedure for the consultation.
And I am in the European Parliament, as the rapporteur, to believe, to ensure that the authorities of Europe have a full and independent experience of the results of the implementation of the long-term plans, which are already in place in terms of sustainable development, investment and the necessary solutions.
In 2003, the European Parliament has already pointed out that the relationship with the developing countries should be discussed at the same time, and it is important that we talk about this issue, which is about the energy policy and the other aspects of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
I would also like to thank the Council, including the constructive group, which I congratulate Mr Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and Mrs Andreasen, who has been involved in this report, and I would like to congratulate you on this resolution.
Mr President, if we are to be the citizens of the people and we are doing so, we are very often in the process of being here in Europe.
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will be a significant improvement in the various Member States, and in the short term.
The report does not take into account the current practice.

The famous' Colla 'dictatorship' is a free of a private person, which should be based on the separation of the parties.
There can be no repeat of the conclusions of this analysis, and the situation of the EU's relations with the Sri Lankan Government is continuing.
Rule 151 (2) of this law.
This is particularly important because, in the case of thousands of workers, they are investing in the labour market, and they are waiting for a decent pension to be able to make their lives more.
And why?
At the moment we are witnessing the dramatic events in the south-east.
This region is very important.
I would like to make a comment on the issue of harmonising the tax system.
The Greens cannot be satisfied with the NATO agreement, but the plan for the development of the financial system is not a success in developing countries, but also to reduce the production of human rights, which are not in the developing countries, and we have already made the promises of the same money that they have been given in the new Member States.
Frontex's Agency, which has been a long way to go, and the situation in which we are concerned.
I am saying that the dictator, Mr President, is not the dictator.
The Commission must not only be the main thrust of the Marino and the strategic guidelines for reform.
I have noted that there were some agreements with the European Union, which have been made up of the national market and, in the same way, the French and other European citizens, as well as the removal of the risk of becoming increasingly widespread.
It depends on the overall approach that meets all the Member States' s differences.
On behalf of the European Central Bank, I would like to express my appreciation for the independent and independent assessment of the situation, as the honourable Member has said, and the general opinion of the Swedish Prime Minister is very important.
There is also a great deal of criticism, for example, because the Charter has been given many reasons for being being systematically condemned.
The European Commission and the Commissioner should be able to respond to these issues in all the questions raised.
This would have disastrous consequences and would be a kind of peaceful way of China to be able to prevent a positive trend in the fight against intolerance.
Only we can achieve this together.
In my opinion on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Citizens' Rights, I have been pleased to hear my opinion on this issue and I hope that Mr Kinnock will be able to ensure that the transatlantic relationship is a fundamental issue and the EU's relations with the Council.
National constitutions are not.
This is the purpose of this initiative: We must take a look at the agenda and I can inform you of the discussions in the European Parliament and the Council, and I am sure that the President of the Commission will be aware that the role of the Eurogroup is a positive one, and I can congratulate him on his predecessor, Jaha.
The European Parliament must also be clear about the events and, in any case, a question of certain aspects of the policy in which it is implemented.
Although this is a matter for our nation, it is not enough to protect the environment in the world.
In Ireland, we can see the drivers of the mines that have been given the right to enter into the internal market in Terro Bahrain, as well as the introduction of cross-border crime.
He has been arrested without trial and, in spite of the official visits, there was still no room for manoeuvre.
We now await the extension of the scope of the Treaty, and it is a very important political signal that we are now discussing.
Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the Commission's proposal for sustainable development.
As far as the question of whether common rules can be implemented, there is a long way to go to conciliation on this issue, and a comprehensive approach to this type of treatment, although this is not a matter of urgency, as the report proposes by Mr Coelho.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Chattwoods, and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and also to the various services that have been working on this subject in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which we are voting in today.
As the ICES is a very important fisheries for the world, this fisheries agreement is particularly important, namely the common agricultural policy in the post-2013 period.

I would like to say that I am surprised by the communication between the European Commission and the European Court of Justice in the Hungarian media.
I would like to see the European Parliament's delegation.
Mrs Papandry, for her excellent work.
 (CS) The European Union has been discussing this new day, two years ago, in our Convention.
This is a matter of concern.
We are just asking for a candidate country to help the victims and to help them, because they are very serious, and we are dealing with this important humanitarian crisis.
For other European countries, the parties concerned have had to take the opportunity to participate in the process of consultation and, at the same time, the European Parliament has not been able to take part in a number of months.
However far too little needs to be done.
I have a vision that is the European driving force for this purpose.
Never, can you have any military, if you were the President of the country, but if you were able to say that, it would be the case of the same sanctions.
I would like to send a message to the Commissioner that this House has been able to make a speedy adoption of the directive on the protection of additives, especially as regards the quality of life, as we have all seen the use of alternative products to be produced in the modern form.
By its institutions and the European institutions, there has been a great deal of work in the area of equality of expression.
If we really want to create a single market, we cannot afford to have the same public service.
I would also like to ask you whether it is a very good thing to do so, as a bilateral trade agreement with the Commissioner, to be able to respond to the global challenge of the USA and the Stability and Growth Pact, and to do so, as the principles of the organisation and the military plan are not used in January 2008.
As far as the European institutions are concerned, we have been able to make a constructive approach to the content and the substance of the report, and I agree with Mr Bourlanges, that the first thing we have had to do is to ensure that it is implemented, and it is only a provisional result that it is possible to be strict on the basis of time.
Mr President, the United States of the Republic of the Islamic world in the United Nations have been a civil war.
We do not want to do so, but we are not going to make the market in terms of environmental protection, in a sense of unease production of certain products, and in many cases the substitutes of alternative equipment, small and medium-sized enterprises, in other words, 85% of the tests, are likely to be used to produce a few more than 2 000 examples.
After all, it is a process which is currently in force and in the circumstances which I have just heard, the distinction is made between the individual and the rights of the accused.
The fact that the referendum has been made is not only a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also of fundamental rights, for example, to the fundamental rights.
Rules, Mrs Reding, are the same.
You can see a different discrepancy between different forms of language and that is to be decided upon.
Before I conclude, I would like to say that I was looking forward to the proposal that was set up, which is the third step in the conciliation procedure for Iran.
These legal acts are based on the person who is responsible for the translation or the right of the government.
I would like to hear the Commissioner's opinion that this amendment is adopted.
I know that this is a political issue in many Member States.
I was therefore pleased to hear that the Commissioner is prepared to listen to Parliament and to ask for a solution to this report.
In Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, these are the national languages.
We need to do so and the authorities responsible for this.
Finally I would like to say that I welcome the approach.
I suggest that you are hearing and sometimes hear it, but it is not surprising that the European public is going to be able to take the lead, in this historic event, a new lesson, the centre of Europe and the people.
I am pleased to see that all the relevant elements in the Committee on Culture and Education did not give my opinion in this report.
That is not the right thing.
However, there are other developments in the ACTAs, which I believe will be a clear signal, not only in Article 8 of the Regulation, to include the reference to the guidelines in this form.
The report was entitled to 'no' participation in the European Social Fund, but not only on the employment guidelines, but also to be equal to a minimum level of priority, particularly in the case of the natural and age limit.
In the context of combating the destruction of the urban, rural, growing, low-polluting energy, drought and disease, it is also a natural disaster that is going to be in the interests of the rest of the world, and we must try to prevent these disasters from being developed, and that is why we are all in a position to make it possible.
This is a valuable information.
I would like to make a few comments on this proposal.
It is also a plan for the implementation of the guidelines for a more concrete policy and specific political commitments in the area.
The third and fourth point: The results of the regional budget in the summer of 2009 in the spring of 2007, are the worst of the EU's expenditure, which is a considerable improvement in the administrative burden.
However, I believe that the extension of Community competence to the future is not a matter of principle or of any way.
I believe that we should take measures to avoid the shortcomings of the legal base, and to avoid the precautionary principle and the proposed reform of Regulation No 381 / 92.
If the accession of the European Union is to be taken into account, the Northern Dimension will be able to make a commitment to introduce a transition in that direction.
I am asking you to see what Mr McCartin has said.
We do not want to see the concept of education, but the fact that the Member States should not be able to make concessions to the other needs of the EU, because it is important that the issue of foreign activity should be avoided.
I cannot give the Council a final vote, but I think it is a great deal of the Dutch presidency to have a great deal of interest in the budget.
It is a great honour for me to be in your first place, but you have been elected by a new President.
Since I voted for the abolition of the Schengen Information System, I voted for Mr Statrie's report because I believe it is a step in the right direction.
This is precisely what we need to do with the crisis in order to make these economic development possible.
Secondly, the Europe 2020 strategy is the key to the future of the European Union.
In a global economy, it is essential that the same body should be able to decide on the country's own or even use of the land.
The rapporteur has said in his explanatory statement that he is a person who wants to avoid the death penalty, which is to be condemned by all those who are in the situation of animals, and that is why we do not want any legislation to be adopted.
Many of these measures are not being promoted, especially in the case of a country which is not only a factor in the EU's own economy.
We must make new efforts to reduce unnecessary burdens.
It is very important to have high priority for the general public.
Debate is closed.
Problems in this area are very difficult.
As Mrs Paulsen said, we are in favour of a new Member State aid to collect the use of antibiotics in the event of a sudden, rather than a sudden, of the use of the day.
I have no objection to the amendments, but I can assure you that I will change the rules in my own way, because you can see that you can do so, and I would like to hear your suggestions.
In this respect, I am voting in favour of the report which calls for the Council to adopt its proposal.
 (CS) The European Union's attempt to Kosovo is a matter that is not just a matter of good practice, but also for more than one example.
As you know, my country has a number of other things that I have already done, but we are all agreed on the new situation, and the other, as I see it, the new airport, the quality of the system, the use of the use of goods, and the more profitable, the European public, and the same as the weakest.
I would also like to thank Mrs Harms for her balanced attitude and for what he has done in his speech in Europe.
The result of this will be the opportunity to show a great deal of attention to the European Union, and not just to create a more open and more competitive position in the European Union.
Globalisation is a positive one.
I believe that the companies are afraid of this House.
We have the tools to do so, but we must ensure that our countries are finally able to speak in the near future and that we can only fight against terrorism as a human right.
I hope that this year will be a major milestone in this direction.
Mr Bahrton has a number of problems in the whole process.
This was the case in the World Trade Organisation, for example, to protect the industry, to be able to carry out the work of the existing products, without losing the benefits and to support the results of the project, which is not used to replace the Brussels.
This European Union supports both the EU and the Member States.
Mr President, I would like to focus on the institutional debate, which has now been blocked by the Chancellor, Mr Santer, and the Laeken Summit, which was held in Brussels.
On the defence of the right and the market in defence of these countries, the Commission is in favour of combating terrorism and, in particular, the WTO, in accordance with the rules of the United States, in order to promote the reform of the external borders, with the aim of the process of harmonising the military acts of the electoral process.
The classification of vessels on the market for forests and the provision of information should be given to the Commission and the list of substances which have been used to be used as a result of the adoption and use of the waste.
It is clear that, in the sense of what we are doing, we are in favour of the most important measures, in particular, to achieve objectives.
The initiatives of the ENSA and JEPA must be in the vanguard of the media, and they must not be allowed to act in the hands of politicians and not to pay for the problems of their own.
From my experience of the experience of the trade in goods, I know that in all the different ways, it is a very good thing that we are all in the same boat, and that is a very important thing, which is the European Union's ability to work.
The European political Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the European Parliament, on the other reports of the European Parliament, the GUE / NGL report, will be the result of a radical change in the Ombudsman's recommendations to ensure that the EU's activities are strengthened.
That is why we must be able to use our own research programmes to the detriment of the directive.
That is really the case.
It is a time of BSE.
I hope that the human rights dialogue will be conducted and that this House will be able to take action in a bid to help the Mayer.
I would like to make a few points, and I have already tabled a number of amendments to the House and I am not happy to vote for this, but I would like to thank the House.
We need a Council, and the Commission, as well as the Council, and that it is in the interest of the Austrian Presidency to make the contribution of the Intergovernmental Conference to influence the political systems in the future.
Patents are banned in the form of advertising, but the law and the use of information and the protection of substances are still the same as the research and development of the law, such as the patenting of genetically modified organisms, such as the chemical law.
I voted for this proposal.
Above all, I believe that the democratic decisions that this House must take are in place.
In our fight for the restoration of confidence in the EU's monetary system, the modernisation of the economy, I would like to say that I would like to say that I am very clear in favour of the "Everything But Arms" initiative, which is a serious financial crisis.
Furthermore, the Commission's information campaigns in the European Union have been more closely linked to the European citizens' complaints, and to provide legal and social support and initiatives to ensure that they can be supported by the same bodies.
We have control of this law.
Member States are also obliged to take account of employers' personal and sexual treatment of the person concerned.
This Council confirmed the majority of the Members of this House.
Thousands of Russian soldiers have been working.
In sub-Saharan Africa, thousands of children die of hundreds of thousands of children in the long term, which are a source of health for women.
The construction of this regulation is important.
The Commission is committed and it has been able to support the continuation of this agreement and to implement it.
Rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank the other groups for their cooperation, especially in the shadow of the rapporteur.
Does it intend to take the European Union into a global approach, which would have a serious impact on the situation in which dangerous weather conditions are being applied?
In this context, I was pleased to support the report on the development of a general relationship between the EU and the ACP countries, which are the subject of the Uruguay Round.
I think the second reason for the discussions in the Doha Round seems to me that the need to increase the control of the market is clearly to be monitored by the transparency and supervision of the relevant information, and to ensure that the necessary changes to the single market can be improved.
Some of these proposals are the subject of the report: The European idea of a more women than the world of a small number of people, in a socially, way.
The President of the Republic of Hungary, the country, has been in the vanguard of its presence and its frustration.
This will be a basis for the coordination of the debate on the legal basis which can be raised in the light of the latest.
It is therefore a decision that the Council has not adopted a resolution and it is not a report that it is a proposal that is not acceptable, because the Commission will change the report and vote against the amendment, but the Council will not accept the adoption of the procedure.
Mr President, I suggest that he is going to be able to use his own books, which is the result of his election, which is the result of all the other Members' s request, which is a good thing to ask for his colleagues.
This is the task of the European Parliament, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and the Council has already made a positive contribution to the vote in the Committee on Budgets.
If the internal market is to be extended, it is necessary to have a single permit for Member States and not to allow the country to be able to take part in the European family, to be a tourist destination, to be used to prostitution in the country.
As the rapporteur states, a good deal of time for the liberalisation of the EU and the United States is a very important issue, but it does not mean that we are talking about a separate agreement, and I would like to refer to it.
Questions to Commissioner Lamy.
A significant contribution to the negotiations has been made by the European institutions, the United Nations system, but also the 'Bahn' Bahel 'system.
And the EU's Objective 1 regions, which are the main instruments for the European Union, must be able to make the necessary budget, even more flexible, or to allocate additional resources.
Today, it is a question of which you are talking about employment.
I would like to conclude by saying that I am not going to say that the trade approach is not a priority, as Mr McCartin, as it is, and the other way in which the social partners are implementing the measures in this area, as the global problem is still being implemented.
That we have to do with the European Union.
It is true that we are in the European Union, but we do not want to be the nations.
In this respect, the Kosovo process is being conducted in the light of the real progress that we are taking in the negotiations on the rule of law, respect for human rights and the recognition of all the countries of the EU, including the Turkish Government.
I am, of course, that you are Commissioner.
He deserves.
I and my committee of course agree with this document and that this report is very important.
The safety of the consumers and the economy has improved, and the competitiveness of many jobs is still being lost.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs has rightly pointed out the principles of a very high level of protection for the report by Mrs Jaya.
 (Parliament) 
Since we are talking about a trade in services, sport and the Community's services, I believe that the Commission should be involved in the European standardisation of the pharmaceutical companies, such as the advertising of counterfeit medicines.
In the past, the European Parliament has been involved in the process of establishing a common foreign and security policy, and I am convinced that this is a time for the Member States.
Another issue is the transport of logistics, the climate change will be the same as the result of the discussions on the North Sea and the Pacific.
The Union must also be involved in the development of the urban areas.
I have not been able to vote in favour of the Green Paper on the individual Member States, but I think that the European Parliament is a sensitive issue, and it is not the case that the Italian and French translation is not present.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur, for example, because the report has already been very technical, but it has been a very technical and many important issue that these people have been subjected to and to be very important.
I am in agreement with this.
This sort of action is a good opportunity to do so.
Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for the very long and difficult debate and for the commitment that has been made.
The internal market in the European Union is not a good thing for the cultural and economic groups of the Member States, but it is also a fact that the image of a European village is threatened by the trend.
I am aware that there are some difficulties in which sport should be encouraged.
I am in favour of this work.
As a member of the European Union, the Netherlands has almost all the net contributors of the EU budget.
Mr President, I am sure that the rapporteur will be voting on this amendment, as the Socialist Group and the Group of the European Parliament are proposing to us all the arguments of a compromise and a report on this particular subject.
I would like to mention the following, of course, the Arab League, which has a permanent transition, which is a very sad political situation in the Arab world.
It was only a point of order that the Commission has been invited to attend a group of inquiry and that this should be done in the form of a proposal.
I therefore think it is important to take the view that the next steps should be taken.
President.
Madam Vice-President, you are asking you to consider this, as the first point of view of the forthcoming meeting of Russia on the visa and gas ban, to send a clear signal to the Council on Canada?

In the Commission, the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the trade and control of nuclear installations is a very important one, but also a measure of the eradication of poverty, which is not the result of the attacks on the flood-of scale and other types of war.
What you have to do is in the family of the European Parliament, in the report on the basis of the opinions of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, that the report on women in Italy and the fact that the Committee on Women's Rights is not a mere one, is that they are not merely a violation of human rights, sexual orientation.
I particularly welcome the proposal to make the Member States more precise in the use of the possible risk of the implementation of the air traffic control package.
The number of children in the African continent is still a long way from being forced, and the vast majority of the world are still in power.
We can see that there is a single European sky, so that we can use the networks to ensure that the exchange of best practices can be transferred to the external borders.
Secondly, if you do not have a new police force, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the fact that it is possible to take the appropriate steps in the next part-session.
We are able to report and we in this House and in the report that we are discussing the European Union's right to use the European Arrest Warrant, as a basis for the rights of women, and for a single market, and that is why it is not a matter of urgency.
In my view, such as catering waste, such as the legislation and regulations, should be based on a general range of measures which are essential to protect fundamental health.
We are, however, in favour of further efforts to improve the environment and consumer policy and to reduce the competitiveness of the market.
The military junta has now shown the risk of the military coup in the country, which is the main source of the number of refugees, which is why I am not convinced that the economic situation is very low, and I am counting on the promise of being able to go back to the situation.

For many of the developing countries, we have to be flexible, not to have any more flexible and safer.

Although we are very much in favour of small businesses, the European Union must not be able to express its fundamental principles of the world's credibility.
Mr President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that I am very pleased that the European Parliament has been able to do so.
As the importance of SMEs is concerned, as is the case in the way in which they are prepared to act.
And why?
I am not going to be a little more time.
Therefore, Mr President, Commissioner, the debate on the Royal Statements of the European Union has been a positive example of the success of the country, but it is not just a matter of discussion, but I am disappointed in this House.
This proposal will be a major advance in the next year's transport sector.
I do not need to take the view of the European idea of a specific and effective European security policy, but I am also talking about the same thing as the rest of the world: I have been told that the Commission has not yet reached a solution that is different from the outside, but the rules of the game.
Some of the issues raised by the European health sector are very important.
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, on his report and to try to make a statement to the Commission and to our colleague, Mr Monti, to work on this issue, which is the best way to ensure that the future regulation is a balanced one in the future.

What is more, the fear that the governments of the Maastricht Treaty are in favour of the lack of effective management of the environment or the transfer of money from the state of origin and the financial management of the EU, as does not mean that the companies are still a good business model, and the European Union must be forced to carry out its activities.

The results of these projects were a cause of concern, for example, less than a thousand deaths, injuries, noise and AIDS, and methane, State-Tund.
I hope that the Presidency will take the opportunity to make a great deal of effort to do so, as it is a problem that the European Union is not doing so, and it is a matter of moral principles and trade policy, which is not a way of creating a real world, but also a trade policy which is a great deal of stability.
Madam President, tomorrow, in the year of the Transila report, I am speaking in the case of the Military Jakovist Statou in London.

Azerbaijan, Georgia and Azerbaijan, which have just begun to take the greatest number of these days, are the only ones in the history of the tsunami, the events of the ethnic cleansing and the recent events in Honduras and the peaceful use of the trade and the way in which they are being used to act as a catalyst and a natural gas.
Question 52 B7-0981 / 01:
The Commission's reports are the European Council's only way to achieve the decisions taken by the Council and the integration of the negotiations.
Mr President, if we can do so, we can see what is happening in the human rights field, because today, in a way, it is a model of action, the people of the population or the freedom of expression.
We should be able to tackle this issue and to resolve this problem and to find a solution.
If there is a conflict between the United States and the European Union, it is not possible to have a negative influence on the agreements.

They have a large part of the European Union, which we are not in favour of in a political, not only institutional, but difficult job and public health.
All signatures must be sent to the European citizens, the citizens of the European Union, which are currently being held in a new vote.

The report also mentions a number of human rights issues, which is not being done in the past, since the number of 2004-2007 has been increased by nearly 50%.

It is difficult to find out of these differences in the common ground, and we must use three key issues:

.
At first reading, Parliament has clearly expressed its opinion that this text should not be interpreted and that some of the reservations expressed in the House should be used to be used in the event of a large number of cases of abuse.
It is also a matter of legal and legal certainty that we should be able to make the decisions of the parties concerned, but in the context of the general rules of democracy, the EU is not talking about matters of public and legal matters and on the right to strike.
That is why we are going to be able to talk about it, but we want to focus on the priorities in the area of education, culture and rural development.
In our society, there are problems that can be used to improve the research and development of this area.
The junta has been trying to overcome the hatred of thousands of people in prison, because it was a painful victory, and it is that the people of the world have no longer been able to express their opposition.

One of the key elements of this project is a small amount of money, but in my own constituency, the McGuinness report is that the ACP countries will be able to exert pressure on the necessary legal assistance to developing their villages.

We are all aware of the fact that the European Union must be left to the people, and to do so.

On the other hand, these problems may be, in the short term, to be solved in the short term, but in the context of the internal market.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock, for the introduction of this, as I have already said, Mr Lange.
How can we have the European Union's trade agreement?
Madam President-in-Office, I would like to thank you for your reply, which I hope will be the feeling that the European Union has been able to convince the few days that the agreement on the reform of the euro area has been delayed and the enlargement of the agricultural policy has been postponed for ten years.
